Why Zelensky can't and won't give up Crimea,Ukraine's leader has ruled out recognising Russian control of the peninsula as part of a Trump peace plan.,Europe,"War in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia, Crimea, Ukraine",Paul Kirby,2025-04-24T14:40:31.465Z,2025-04-24T14:40:31.465Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bce0/live/12ec20e0-2115-11f0-8c58-0f3e2186d95e.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bce0/live/12ec20e0-2115-11f0-8c58-0f3e2186d95e.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2x58m46e1o,"Vladimir Putin initially denied having anything to do with Russia's capture of Crimea in February 2014, when mysterious masked commandos in unidentified green uniforms seized the local parliament and fanned out across the peninsula.

Those ""little green men"" marked the start of Russia's war on Ukraine, which culminated in the 2022 full-scale invasion.

The future of Crimea is now at the centre of President Donald Trump's peace plan and has prompted Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky to rule out recognising Russian control of the peninsula.

The exact terms of his plan have not been published, but reports suggest it would include the US recognising Crimea as a legal part of Russia -de jurein Latin.

For Trump, Ukraine's southern peninsula was ""lost years ago"" and ""is not even a part of discussion"" in peace talks.

But for Zelensky to renounce Crimea as an indivisible part of Ukraine would be unconscionable.

In the words of opposition MP Iryna Gerashchenko ""territorial integrity and sovereignty is a red line for Ukraine and Ukrainians"".

Trump made the point that ""if [Volodymyr Zelensky] wants Crimea, why didn't they fight for it 11 years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired?""

Few shots were fired, but Crimea was seized at gunpoint during a power vacuum.

Putin later admitted hatching the land-grab in an all-night meeting with his officials days after Ukraine's pro-Russian leader was ousted in Kyiv.

For a US leader in a hurry to secure a peace deal, Crimea could become a big stumbling block.

Trump is correct that there is little chance of Ukraine regaining Crimea in the foreseeable future, and it is in reality - de facto - under Russian control. But that is a far cry from recognising it as legal.

Zelensky points to a 2018 ""Crimea declaration"" by Trump's then secretary of state, Mike Pompeo.

Pompeo said the US rejected ""Russia's attempted annexation of Crimea"" and pledged to continue until Ukraine's territorial integrity was restored.

Zelensky's implication is that Trump backed Ukraine on Crimea then, and should stick to that now.

If a landgrab unrecognised by the international community is approved by the US as legal, what would that mean for international law and the principles of the UN charter?

Weeks after Russia's full-scale war began, there was an initial proposal in Istanbul to park the issue so that Russia and Ukraine would aim to resolve it in the next 10-15 years.

The idea did not take hold but it was a way of getting over that stumbling block.

Zelensky was adamant that he has no power to give up Crimea: ""There's nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution.""

Article 2 of the constitution states that Ukraine's sovereignty ""extends throughout its entire territory"" which ""within its present border is indivisible and inviolable"".

Any change to Ukraine's territory has to go to a national referendum, which must be authorised by the Ukrainian parliament.

It is not just President Trump that has problems with Kyiv. Russia also sees the Ukrainian constitution as an ""obstacle"" to peace efforts.

Constitutions can be changed, but not while Ukraine is under martial law.

Approving Russia's illegal annexation would not just be a red line for Ukraine but would be a terrifying precedent for countries such as Romania that border the Black Sea. The precedent would be felt far beyond the Black Sea.

For historical reasons, Russians have long seen Crimea as part of their territory and Putin has spoken of a ""living and unbreakable bond"" with the peninsula, with its Black Sea resorts and balmy summer climate.

But Crimea along with the rest of Ukraine voted for independence from the collapsing Soviet Union in 1991 and Kyiv allowed Russia to lease the port of Sevastopol as a base for the Black Sea Fleet.

After its annexation in 2014 Putin sought to cement Russia's control over Crimea, first with a 12-mile bridge built over the Kerch Strait in 2018 and then by capturing a land bridge along the Sea of Azov coast in 2022.

Putin felt he was righting a wrong inflicted on Russia when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred Crimea to Ukraine in 1954. Russia, he said, was ""not simply robbed, it was plundered"".

Crimea was first annexed by Tsarist Russia under Catherine the Great in 1783 and largely remained part of Russia until Khrushchev's decision.

Russia and Ukraine were both Soviet republics so it was not a big deal for the Kremlin in 1954.

More than half the population of Crimea was Russian, largely because the original majority population of Crimean Tatars were deported under the Soviet dictator Stalin in 1944.

Tatars were only able to return to Crimea from exile from 1989 as the Soviet Union fell apart, and they now make up about 15% of Crimea's population.

Russia quickly organised a referendum in March 2014 but it was rejected as a sham by the international community and the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution backing Ukrainian sovereignty.

The International Criminal Court ruled that Russia's activity in Crimea amounted to ""ongoing occupation"".

Refat Chubarov, Chairman of the Mejlis, a body representing Crimean Tatars, has insisted that Ukraine must categorically reject any territorial concession in exchange for peace.

""Crimea is the homeland of the indigenous Crimean Tatar people and an integral part of Ukraine,"" he said.

Trump's peace plan has not yet been published, but according to various reports and remarks by US officials, Ukraine would be required to adhere to other difficult conditions.

Russia's occupation of almost 20% of Ukraine would be de facto recognised behind existing front lines, in effect freezing the conflict in four Ukrainian regions: Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

That would be backed up by a ""robust security guarantee"", according to US outlet Axios, presumably backed up by a ""coalition of the willing"" involving the UK, France but not the US.

There would be a promise not to admit Ukraine into Nato, although it could join the EU.

All US sanctions would be lifted and economic co-operation with the US enhanced.

Axios also suggests Russia would return a small area of occupied Kharkiv and allow Ukraine ""unimpeded passage"" on the Dnieper river, while the US would take charge of the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, seized by Russia in 2022.

And then there is a US-Ukraine deal to share minerals profits, which Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal is expected to seal with the US by Saturday.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2x58m46e1o
Harry and Meghan call for stronger social media protections for children,"They told the BBC they want to ensure ""no more kids are lost to social media"" in unveiling a memorial.",Technology,"Social media, UK Royal Family, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex",Sean Coughlan,2025-04-24T14:00:15.875Z,2025-04-24T14:00:15.875Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/724f/live/5acb3250-2103-11f0-b122-c52cf00da345.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/724f/live/5acb3250-2103-11f0-b122-c52cf00da345.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjewne81lq4o,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are calling for stronger protections for children from the dangers of social media, saying ""enough is not being done"".

Prince Harry and Meghan are unveiling a memorial in New York City they say is dedicated to children who have died due to the harms of the internet.

""We want to make sure that things are changed so that... no more kids are lost to social media,"" Prince Harry told BBC Breakfast in New York.

""Life is better off social media,"" he said, adding he was ""grateful"" that his and Meghan's children were still too young to be online.

""The easiest thing to say is to keep your kids away from social media. The sad reality is the kids who aren't on social media normally get bullied at school because they can't be part of the same conversation as everybody else,"" Prince Harry told journalists at an Archwell Foundation event in New York.

The installation unveiled by Prince Harry and Meghan is called the Lost Screen Memorial, and is made from 50 smartphones, each displaying the screen photo of a child whose life was lost ""due to the harms of social media"". It will be open for 24 hours.

The children's images were shared by parents who are part of the Parents' Network, set up by Prince Harry and Meghan's Archewell Foundation. This is a support network for parents whose children have experienced harm from social media.

Prince Harry and Meghan have been supporting families who say social media played a role in the deaths of their children.

They have backed calls to technology firms that parents should be able to gain access to information on the phones of children who have died, despite arguments about privacy.

The prince said tech firms were ""getting away with it"" by arguing they didn't need to disclose information to UK families because of privacy considerations.

""You are telling a parent, you are telling a dad and a mum that they can't have the details of what their kid was up to on social media because of the privacy of their kid. It's wrong,"" said the prince.

Meghan said the danger of social media was a global issue and ""one thing we can all agree on is that children should be safe"".

She praised the parents who were speaking out.

""I think in many ways what we see through these parents is the hope and the promise of something better, because... they just want to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else,"" said Meghan.

""We're just grateful that our kids are too young to be on social media at this point,"" said Prince Harry.

Among theUK families who have gone to New York to call for better protectionsis Ellen Roome from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire.

She believes her 14-year-old son Jools died after an online challenge went wrong in 2022 and his social media accounts could provide the evidence needed. An inquest into his death found he took his own life.

She was among a group of British parents who took their own action, separate to the Archewell Foundation, in staging a protest outside Meta's offices on Thursday.

Earlier in the week she told BBC Breakfast: ""It's too late for our son Jools, but there are plenty of other children around the world that we still need to help. This is a massive issue globally.

""There was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem,"" said Ellen, who now wants to warn other parents that ""you don't know what your children are looking at"".

Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has said it shares the goal of keeping teens safe online.The firm said it had recently introduced ""teen accounts"" with enhanced protections.

""We believe teens deserve consistent protections across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms,"" Meta said in a statement.

In the UK on Thursday, the media regulator Ofcom published measures intended toimprove protections for children online, including requiring tougher age checks and more robust action to prevent children accessing harmful content.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjewne81lq4o
UK edges towards post-Brexit youth visa deal with EU,"An agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations for a post-Brexit ""reset"".",Europe,"European Union, Brexit",Paul Seddon,2025-04-24T13:11:18.051Z,2025-04-24T13:11:18.051Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c944/live/06c07810-2107-11f0-b1ba-8bc47850ff39.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c944/live/06c07810-2107-11f0-b1ba-8bc47850ff39.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qw58r0x0do,"The government is no longer ruling out a youth visa deal with the EU, ahead of a summit next month to ""reset"" relations after Brexit.

Labour has previously said it has ""no plans"" for such a scheme, which would would make it easier for young people to study and work abroad.

But an agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations between the two sides to boost co-operation. Downing Street declined to repeat its previous opposition to reporters on Thursday, saying it would not provide a ""running commentary"" on talks.

It comes as over 60 Labour MPs called on ministers to strike a ""new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30"".

In a letter to EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, they argued a mutual deal for time-limited visas, subject to a cap, would ""extend new cultural, educational, and economic opportunities to young people in the UK"".

Sir Keir Starmer is expected to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later, as preparations increase for the summit in London on 19 May.

The Labour government is aiming to forge closer economic ties to the EU after Brexit. Both sides have also expressed a renewed interest in a defence and security pact amid the war in Ukraine.

A defence deal would potentially unlock full UK access to a €150bn (£128bn) EU-backed loans scheme, with British firms otherwise limited to providing up to 35% of the value of projects funded under the scheme.

Speaking at a conference on Thursday, Germany's ambassador to the UK Miguel Berger said he wanted to see progress on a youth visa deal as part of a ""package approach"" to the talks, where different topics are linked together.

He added that EU citizens had faced ""many obstacles"" to moving to the UK since Brexit, including ""very high thresholds"" for skilled work visas.

The UKcurrently offers visasallowing young people from 10 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year.

Applicants from these countries need at least £2,530 in savings, cannot apply for most benefits, and have to pay an annual NHS surcharge ranging from £776 for students to £1,035 for workers.

The European Commission first suggested an EU-wide youth dealin April last year, claiming Rishi Sunak's government had approached European capitals to discuss individual visa deals, risking ""differential treatment"" of EU citizens.

Under its original proposal, people aged between 18 and 30 would be able to apply for visas lasting up to four years, with no restrictions on time spent working, studying, training or volunteering.

It also said EU applicants should not have to pay the NHS surcharge, and should be able to pay pay the same university tuition fees as British students, rather than the higher fees they have had to pay since Brexit.

The EU has been keen to stress that a visa deal would not replicate the bloc's rules on freedom of movement, under which EU citizens were automatically entitled to live and work in the UK without applying for a visa.

Documents circulated between EU states also suggest a deal could be rebranded as a ""youth experience"" scheme, in a bid to downplay any link to migration.

In his comments on Thursday, Mr Berger insisted a deal would have ""nothing to do with migration"" as those taking part in the scheme would ""go home"" once their visa has ended.

There have been reports that the Home Office, tasked with delivering government plans to lower overall migration, is pushing for any eventual agreement to be subject to a visa cap.

This would conflict with the European Commission's original plans, which would have no limit on numbers.

Asked about the reports, Mr Berger declined to comment, saying that ""we have to leave that to the negotiations"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qw58r0x0do

Iceberg tracks found off UK coast could shed light on Antarctica,Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.,Climate,"Antarctic, Science & Environment, Glaciers, Climate",Mark Poynting and Georgina Rannard,2025-04-24T09:00:09.196Z,2025-04-24T09:00:09.196Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c8d6/live/a83c2fa0-20ed-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c8d6/live/a83c2fa0-20ed-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2xz664r2do,"Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.

Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.

It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.

The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.

The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.

This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.

The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.

Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.

""We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,"" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journalNature Communications.

""These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.""

Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.

By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.

That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.

The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved fromthe Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.

Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.

""Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'""

Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.

But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.

Exactly how this plays out, though, is ""one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise"", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.

That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.

No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.

By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.

The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.

That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.

And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.

The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.

Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.

""These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,"" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.

""But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,"" he argued.

She also said that her four other children had been ""stolen by the state"", and described her family, which she did not want to be part of, as ""bigoted"".

Marten, 37, and Mark Gordon, 50, deny gross negligence manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child.

They are facing a retrial at the Old Bailey. Marten had been due to start giving evidence on Tuesday but complained of a toothache and headache.

In their first trial, they were found guilty of concealing the birth of a child and perverting the course of justice by not reporting the death of their baby.

The couple's baby Victoria, their fifth child, was found dead in a shed on a Brighton allotment, in a shopping bag covered in rubbish in March 2023. Her body was so badly decomposed that pathologists could not ascertain the cause of death.

Their four other children had previously been taken into care.

Giving evidence for the first time on Thursday, Marten was asked by her barrister Mr FitzGibbon KC if she loved her daughter.

""Absolutely"", Marten replied.

""Did you do anything to cause her harm?"", Mr FitzGibbon KC asked.

""Absolutely not. We did everything we could to protect her"", Marten said.

She was then asked how she felt now about her daughter's death.

Marten said: ""I don't think this process has really allowed me to grieve properly. I still feel angry, upset. Still an element of shock"".

Asked about the couple's four other children Marten said she ""loved them extremely.""

""Not being with them is very, very hard"".

When Mr FitzGibbon KC asked if she agreed with the decisions made about taking the children away, Marten said ""absolutely not… it's an absolute outrage"", adding that her children were ""stolen by the state"".

Marten told the jury that since she was little she always wanted to have a big family, adding ""at least seven children would be my dream"". She said she would have liked to live on a farm.

She said she met Mark Gordon about 10 years ago in a shop in East London. ""I sort of see it as fate,"" she said.

Asked how she feels about him, she said: ""I love him very much"", adding that he was ""very dear"" to her.

When asked about whether she would describe her background as privileged, Marten said ""financially yes, emotionally not all"".

She said she tried to introduce Gordon to members of her family, but she found them to be ""very cold"" towards him.

""I have always had a frosty relationship with my family.

""They can be quite bigoted. I don't really want to be part of it"", she said.

""I didn't really grow up with them,"" she said. ""I went to boarding school when I was about eight.""

She said that when she got pregnant with Victoria, she and Gordon had at first planned to move abroad but her family intervened.

As a result, they left their home in London and lived in a series of hotels and bed and breakfasts, she explained, adding that in the week before Christmas 2022, they rented a cottage in Northumberland.

On Christmas Eve they went shopping for baby equipment at Primark in Carlisle where she started feeling that the baby was coming.

""I started having birth pangs pretty much as we started leaving Carlisle,"" she said.

She drove back to the cottage and said she gave birth leaning against the bed upstairs without medical assistance. ""It was a very quick birth actually, Very easy,"" she said.

Two days later the family moved on again.

""Obviously it would have been nicer to have been somewhere stable and to have been able to properly relax… but we weren't in that position"", she told the jury.

Earlier in the trial Gordon declined to give evidence in his defence.

Opening the defence for his client John Femi-Ola KC said: ""I do not propose to call Mr Gordon.""

More sunshine and a change in the wind direction are expected to bring the warmest weather of the year so far.

It might even be time to dust off the BBQ and apply the sunscreen.

Saturday sees temperatures range from 13-17C with the possibility of western areas seeing some rain. Eastern parts of the UK are likely to stay dry but there will be a good deal of cloud.

On Sunday the next band of rain will be pushed back to Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England and Wales, as pressure starts to rise, the cloud will break to leave sunnier skies and it will start to warm up.

The two largest marathons in the UK both take place on Sunday and many runners will be hoping the warmer weather starts a day later.

TheLondonmarathon will be dry and mostly sunny with light winds. At the start of the race, temperatures will be 13C but for runners finishing around mid-afternoon it will be a warm 20 or 21C.

For the marathon inManchesterthere will be spells of sunshine and it should stay dry. A gentle south-westerly breeze is expected with the temperature peaking at 17C in the afternoon.

From early next week the temperatures continue to climb as the wind changes direction to a south-easterly and we tap into some warmer air from the near continent.

Temperatures will climb widely to 22-23C and it will feel very pleasant in the sunshine. In the Midlands and south-east England temperatures are forecast to reach 25-27C by Wednesday.

This will be the warmest weather of the year so far and the warmest since early September.

It is not unusual to have these temperatures at this time of the year. The highest April temperature ever recorded is 29.4C which was reached in London on 16 April 1949. However, the last time the temperature rose to 27C in April was in 2018 in Cambridge.

Ablocked weather patternwith high pressure to the east of the UK and low pressure to the west means the heat will be drawn up from continental Europe.

This pattern could remain in place until the end of next week at least.

The position of the areas of high and low pressure may alter by next weekend, allowing cooler air to reach northern parts of the UK and showers may affect southern areas. This is still some way off and may change.

You can find out how warm it will be where you are on the BBC Weather app or by catching up with the latestWeather for the Week Ahead.

Pakistan suspends visas for Indian nationals after Kashmir attack,It comes after Delhi's retaliatory measures following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.,Asia,"Pakistan, Asia, India, Kashmir",Emily McGarvey,2025-04-24T13:40:56.136Z,2025-04-24T13:40:56.136Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3424/live/c3d23c10-210a-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3424/live/c3d23c10-210a-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy76y52l9eo,"Pakistan has responded with tit-for-tat measures against India as tensions soared following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.

Islamabad suspended all visas issued to Indian nationals under an exemption scheme with immediate effect, as well as expelling some of its neighbour's diplomats and closing its airspace to Indian flights.

Indian police have named three of four suspected gunmen behind the attack, saying two are Pakistani citizens and a third is a local Kashmiri man. Pakistan denies Indian claims that it played a role in the shooting.

Tuesday's attack saw a group of gunmen fire on tourists near Pahalgam, a resort in the disputed Himalayan region.

Police in Indian-administered Kashmir say all three suspects named are members of the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). None of the men have commented on the allegations.

A statement from Pakistan's National Security Committee rubbished attempts to link the Pahalgam attack to Pakistan, saying there had been no credible investigation or verifiable evidence.

Earlier Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed that ""India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers and we will pursue them to the ends of the Earth.""

He said that the ""terrorists behind the killings, along with their backers, will get a punishment bigger than they can imagine"".

""Our enemies have dared to attack the country's soul...  India's spirit will never be broken by terrorism.""

On Wednesday evening Delhi announced a raft of diplomatic measures against Islamabad in light of the killings in Kashmir - one of them was shutting the Attari-Wagah border between the two countries immediately.

India also cancelled visa services to Pakistani nationals ""with immediate effect"".

In its response, Pakistan also rejected India's suspension of the Indus Water Treaty - a six-decade-old water sharing treaty between the neighbours - adding that any attempt to stop or divert the water ""will be considered as an Act of War"".

The country has closed its airspace to all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines and suspended all trade with India.

It has also reduced the number of diplomats in the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to 30 and asked Indian defence, naval and air advisers to leave Pakistan before 30 April.

About 1,500 people across Kashmir have been detained for questioning in connection with the attack, police sources have told BBC News.

Schools, business and shops are reopening after a shutdown across the region following the shootings.

Police have offered a reward of 2m rupees [$23,000; £17,600] for anyone offering information about any of the attackers.

Visitors from different states in India were killed, with others seriously injured, in one of the deadliest attacks in recent years in the region.

An Indian naval officer on honeymoon, a tourist guide who was the sole breadwinner for his family, and a businessman holidaying with his wife and children were among the victims.

An all-party meeting in Jammu and Kashmir expressed deep shock and anguish at what it called a ""barbaric attack"".

The bodies of victims arriving in their home states around India are being given emotional farewells by their families and loved ones.

Meanwhile, reports are coming in from parts of India of Kashmiri students facing harassment in the aftermath of the killings.

A spokesperson for Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's National Conference party said several videos showing students being harassed in colleges and other places were being circulated online.

Nasir Khuehami, head of the Jammu and Kashmir Students' Association, shared a video of a right-wing Hindu group threatening to physically assault Kashmiri Muslim students in the northern state of Uttarakhand to ensure they leave.

'People have been eating chocolate digestives wrong for 100 years',The digestive biscuits were originally intended to be eaten with the chocolate side facing down.,Manchester,Stockport,Kaya Black,2025-04-24T05:16:55.977Z,2025-04-24T13:17:54.630Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/02ec/live/ac2b75c0-20ee-11f0-8451-0101bb35273b.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/02ec/live/ac2b75c0-20ee-11f0-8451-0101bb35273b.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0zdelrdgzo,"The boss of the biscuits factory where McVitie's chocolate digestives have been made for the last 100 years reckons people have always eaten them incorrectly.

Anthony Coulson, general manager at the company's chocolate refinery and bakery in Stockport, said the teatime staple was originally meant to be eaten with the chocolate-covered side facing down.

""It's the world's most incredible debate, whether you have the chocolate on the top or the chocolate on the bottom,"" mused Mr Coulson, who admitted he was a chocolate-on-top man.

The factory opened in 1917, with the chocolate digestive launched eight years later.

About 80 million packets are made every year, with all of the chocolate made in Greater Manchester.

Mr Coulson toldBBC Radio Manchester: ""One of the very first things I learnt when I  got to join McVitie's was chocolate side down to eat the digestive.

""Now up until then I'd always eaten it the other way round...You can do it exactly how you want to do it.""

Mr Coulson said the theory was ""it starts to melt, you start to get the flavour and away you go"", adding: ""It makes sense, right?""

The chocolate digestive was launched about a quarter of a century after the plain variety, whose name was inspired by the belief that the baking powder in the recipe would help with digestion.

Its creation came two years before one of the food manufacturer's other famous brands, the Jaffa Cake, which itself has becomesomething of a confectionery conundrum.

And although people might think of the chocolate digestive as being topped with chocolate, the company has said that as the plain biscuits pass through a ""chocolate reservoir"", the chocolate actually coats the underside of it.

Lynn Loftus, who has worked at the factory for 36 years, called the biscuit ""timeless"", adding that she thought it would be around for many years to come.

Craig Leech, who has worked at McVitie's for 21 years, started off in the factory by putting the chocolate on top of the biscuits.

""I just come in with a positive attitude. I know the people and the products inside out,"" said Mr Leech, who is now a planning manager for the refinery.

Alix Knagg, who has been working there for six months, said the chocolate digestive was ""still a great product 100 years on"".

Ed Miliband 'considering' regional energy pricing,"Ed Miliband says ""zonal pricing"" or reformed national pricing are the only available options to overhaul the energy market.",Politics,Electricity pricing,Sam Francis,2025-04-24T09:39:14.834Z,2025-04-24T12:53:12.302Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1e7e/live/7c8a3720-20f3-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1e7e/live/7c8a3720-20f3-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp91md1lj92o,"Energy secretary Ed Miliband is ""considering"" plans to introduce regional pricing for power that could lead to lower bills in parts of the country that generate more energy.

He did not set out details of the ""zonal pricing"" scheme, which is meant to make the national energy grid more efficient and encourage investment.

But he rejected claims in aDaily Telegraph articlethat it would mean increased energy bills for southern English households.

Some energy companies have backed the idea - but others say it will scare off investment and lead to higher bills.

According to the Telegraph government officials have advised Miliband to back plans for a form of regional pricing used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden.

If implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation.

Under the scheme, power costs would match local supply and demand. In practice it could lead tolower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotlandrather than households in the South.

The scheme is supported by some energy businesses - including Greg Jackson, the boss of Octopus Energy, the UK's largest domestic energy supplier.

Mr Jackson said it could make the overall system more efficient and reduce the amount of network upgrades needed to shift the electricity from where it's generated to where it's consumed.

But Dale Vince, the founder of green energy company Ecotricity and a Labour donor, said on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that zonal pricing was a ""terrible idea"" as ""tens of millions of Britons could end up paying more for their energy than they do now"".

Speaking ahead ofan international energy security summit in London, Miliband said the government were considering options to change energy pricing but insisted ""absolutely no decision has been made"".

""This is an incredibly complex question that we are looking at about how we reform our energy market,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

""There are two options, zonal pricing and reformed national pricing.

""Whatever route we go down my bottom line is bills have got to fall, and they should fall throughout the country.

""We are going to take our time over this very complex and important decision.""



Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the plans ""a form of bribery"", saying cheaper bills would be a payoff for massive infrastructure projects ""ruining"" the local area.

""None of this I think has been fully thought through,"" he argued.

""I think Ed Miliband has a religious fervour for achieving that zero, regardless of the consequences.""

Choosing a new Pope: 'Conclave is quite intimidating',Cardinal Vincent Nichols rules himself out of being the next pontiff as he prepares to vote.,Liverpool,"Catholicism, Crosby, Pope Francis, Roman Catholic Church",Paul Burnell,2025-04-24T05:09:39.130Z,2025-04-24T08:21:23.634Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f0ce/live/5bc5a7a0-20f2-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f0ce/live/5bc5a7a0-20f2-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp31245r694o,"The leader of the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales has said he definitely will not be the next pontiff, but is looking forward to the ""intimidating"" duty of choosing Pope Francis's successor.

Following Pope Francis's death, the next Pope will be chosen by the College of Cardinals, who will gather for a tradition known as the conclave.

Cardinal Vincent Nichols will vote with more than 100 others, but almost missed out, as he is only a few months off his 80th birthday, the age limit for voting rights.

The Merseyside-born Archbishop of Westminster said he thought it would ""pass me by"" until he heard the Pope was seriously ill and thought: ""Oh Lord, this is going to come my way.""

The conclave, which traditionally starts after a two-week mourning period, sees the College of Cardinals gather in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel to cast a series of votes to choose the next pope.

Theoretically, any baptised man can be elected as pope, but a cardinal is usually picked.

There are currently 252 cardinals and while all can take part in the debate about who should be chosen, the voting age restriction means only the 135 who are under 80 can vote.

Cardinal Nichols, who leads six million Roman Catholics in England and Wales, exclusively told BBC North West he ""never thought"" he would be voting because Pope Francis ""didn't show many signs of slowing down"" and appeared to be recovering from double pneumonia.

However, he played down any suggestion of remaining in the Vatican as the next pope himself.

""I'm coming home,"" he said.

""You can be sure of that.""

The 79-year-old archbishop, who was born in Crosby on the Merseyside coast, said he had met Pope Francis several times during high-level meetings in Rome, but had two abiding special memories.

""One particularly has never left me,"" he said.

""He said to me: 'From the moment of my election as Pope, my peace has never left me'.

""Despite the pressure of all he has to deal with, he has lived close to God.""

Cardinal Nichols also said he had fond memories of their last meeting two years ago.

He said an author had asked him to give a copy of their latest book to Pope Francis.

""I gave him the book and said the author was 'very keen that you might have this',"" he said.

""He came back after lunch with a handwritten card and a copy of one of his own books for me to give as a return gift.

""That was quite astonishing.""

Following Pope Francis's funeral on Saturday, Cardinal Nichols will join his fellow cardinals to vote for the 267th pontiff, who will go on to lead the world's estimated 1.4 billion Catholics.

He said the prospect was ""quite intimidating frankly"".

He added that he believed the cardinals would their ""best work once the doors of the conclave have been shut"", as at that point, there would be ""a peace and a prayerfulness between us"".

""I know I have got to get myself together and be a little nuanced to all the political manoeuvring and Paddy Power's bets and all that and say 'actually, this is a group of men trying to discern the will of God,"" he said.

""That's the only thing that matters.""

Many heads of state and royals have confirmed their attendance,including Prince William, French President Emmanuel Macron, Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, and Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Political figures will be out in full force at the ceremony, the most prominent gathering of world leaders since US President Donald Trump's inauguration.

Pope Francis's vocal opinions on global issues occasionally put him at odds with leaders - some of whom will be at the funeral.

Starmer, who No 10 confirmed would attend, described Pope Francis's leadership as ""courageous"" in a statement following his death and said he was a pope ""for the poor, the downtrodden and the forgotten"".

Prince William will attend the funeral on behalf of his father, King Charles III, in keeping with recent tradition. The King, when he was Prince of Wales, attended the funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005 on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II.

King Charles and Queen Camilla were among the last high-profile figures meetthe Pope at his residence Casa Santa Marta during a royal visit to Italy earlier this month.

The King paid tribute to Pope Francis's ""compassion"" and said ""through his care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many"".

He said he and the Queen remembered ""with particular affection"" their meetings with the Pope over the years, and ""were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month"".

Lula, who shared a personal rapport with the Pope, and first lady Janja Lula da Silva, will attend the funeral.

Brazil is home to the world's largest Catholic population, with over 100 million Catholics. Following news of Pope Francis's death on Monday, Lula declared seven days of mourning.

""Humanity loses today a voice of respect and welcome for others,"" Lula said.

Noting the meetings he had held with the Pope over the years, Lula said: ""We were able to share our ideals of peace, equality, and justice - ideals that the world has always needed, and will always need.""

Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he and first lady Melania would attend the Pope's funeral, marking the first foreign trip of his second term as US president.

After news of the Pope's death emerged, Trump ordered that all federal and state flags be flown at half-mast in honour of the late pontiff. He called Pope Francis ""a very good man"" who ""loved the world"" and ""he especially loved people that were having a hard time"".

The pair clashed in the past. In 2016, Pope Francis criticised Trump's proposal to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, saying a person ""who thinks only about building walls"" and ""not building bridges, is not Christian"".

Trump hit back, saying: ""For a religious leader to question a person's faith is disgraceful.""

AfterTrump met the Pope during a trip to the Vatican in 2017, he said: ""He is something, he's really good. We had a fantastic meeting.""

In February, Pope Francis described Trump's mass deportations as a ""major crisis"".

Marcos Jr, who will be in attendance on Saturday, described Francis as the ""best Pope in my lifetime"".

""A man of profound faith and humility, Pope Francis led not only with wisdom but with a heart open to all, especially the poor and the forgotten,"" he said.

The Philippines is one of the world's most Catholic countries, with almost 80% of Filipinos identifying as Roman Catholic.

Pope Francis's last visit to the country in 2015 drew a crowd ofsix million people at an outdoor Mass in the capital city Manila, a record for a papal event.

In the running to become the next Pope is Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle, a Cardinal from the Philippines. Cardinal Tagle has been called the ""Asian Francis"" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants.

The Ukrainian president has said he will travel to Vatican City with first lady Olena Zelenska for the funeral.

""He knew how to give hope, ease suffering through prayer, and foster unity,"" Zelensky wrote on X in tribute to Pope Francis.

""He prayed for peace in Ukraine and for Ukrainians.""

Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Francis maderepeated calls for peace and an end to the war. The two leaders met several times at the Vatican, most recently last October.

Following that meeting, Pope Francis wrote on X: ""All nations have the right to exist in peace and security. Their territories must not be attacked, and their sovereignty must be respected and guaranteed through peace and dialogue.""

Earlier in 2024, Ukrainehad strongly rejecteda call by the pontiff for Kyiv to negotiate an end to the war and have ""the courage to raise the white flag"".

Santa Maria Maggiore: The church to become Pope Francis's resting place,The Pope would visit Santa Maria Maggiore whenever he returned to Rome and chose it as the site of his grave.,Europe,"Pope Francis, Roman Catholic Church, Rome, Italy",Laura Gozzi,2025-04-23T21:41:16.121Z,2025-04-23T21:41:16.121Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7368/live/53ba56c0-2087-11f0-b7c0-4f6e24ac1319.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7368/live/53ba56c0-2087-11f0-b7c0-4f6e24ac1319.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrgzl0vyqpo,"Every time Pope Francis came back to Rome after a trip abroad, he made sure to pay a visit to the church of Santa Maria Maggiore.

It was a fitting choice: Francis was particularly devoted to the Virgin Mary, and Santa Maria Maggiore was the first church to be dedicated to her when it was built in the 4th Century.

It is one of Rome's four major basilicas and one of the oldest in the city.

On Saturday, it will also become Francis's final resting place.

It is a short walk from some of Rome's most recognisable landmarks like the Colosseum, and a stone's throw from the city's endlessly bustling and chaotic central Termini station. The diverse Esquilino neighbourhood is close by.

Santa Maria Maggiore feels steeped in the ""real"" Rome – despite technically being a part of the Vatican state.

The square it stands on - lined with bus stops, cafes and shops - certainly seems a world away from the awe-inspiring St Peter's Square and its imposing basilica, under which Popes are usually buried in centuries-old crypts.

And yet the chapels, mosaics and gilded wood of Santa Maria Maggiore remain stunning. Seven other popes are buried here.

The basilica also hosts what is said to be a relic of Jesus's crib and an icon of Mary, to whom Pope Francis would pray asking for protection before a journey.

Santa Maria Maggiore's senior priest, the Lithuanian Rolandas Makrickas, gave Italian newspaper Il Messaggero his account of how the Pope's decision to be laid to rest there came about.

He said: ""In May 2022… I asked him if he wasn't by any chance thinking about being buried in [the basilica], given how often he came.""

Francis smiled and said that Popes are buried in St Peter's - ""and that was that"", Makrickas thought.

The priest continued: ""A week later he called me and said, 'the Virgin Mary has told me to prepare my tomb'.

""Then he simply told me, 'find a place for it, because I want to be buried in this basilica and you've been a bit of a prophet'.""

The place Mackrickas found is next to the icon of Mary that the Pope so loved. It is now cordoned off and obscured by plywood.

A security guard who wished to remain anonymous told BBC News stories of Pope Francis visiting the church on many occasions.

""Yes, we used to see him all the time when he came here,"" he said, interrupting himself to sternly invite tourists to put their phones away or cover their shoulders.

""After a few times of seeing him, one time he looked at me and asked me, 'why are you always here?'

""And I said, 'Holy Father, I'm working just as you are'.""

As the security guard spoke, people continued to stream in from the blazing sunshine into the quiet shade of the basilica.

Several queued outside wooden booths, each topped with a sign indicating in which languages the priests inside could hear confessions.

Every few minutes, the chatter would be momentarily quietened by a voice hissing over the loudspeaker: ""Silenzio.""

Outside, a woman called Pat from Manchester was squinting at the sun and gathering her thoughts.

""I came here because this is where the Pope used to come before any journey,"" she told the BBC, raising her voice over the sound of the midday bells tolling.

""That's why I've always wanted to come and it hasn't disappointed.""

After a pause, she said: ""Beautiful isn't the word. It's just vast, it's enormous.""

Apologising for not being able to put her emotions into words, she said she was ""particularly impressed"" that many of the six chapels hold different masses at different times, ""so if you're late for one, you can go into another"".

Pat heard the news about the Pope's death when her plane from the UK landed in Rome on Monday morning.

It did not scupper her visit. As a devout Catholic, she said Santa Maria Maggiore ""was always the place I wanted to come"" because Francis loved it so.

""I came without any sort of preconceived idea and I made a point of not reading up about it, I just wanted to take the atmosphere in, and feel it.""

""And I did,"" she said, looking up at the basilica. ""I am full of the spirit.""

On Saturday afternoon, after the world has had a chance to bid farewell to him, Pope Francis will make his final journey from the Vatican to Santa Maria Maggiore, as he did so often in life.

The church will be shut for a few hours, then the stream of visitors will resume.

Some, like Pat, will continue to come to the basilica and try to put something intangible into words. Others will simply admire the mosaics.

And on the left hand side, by an icon of the Virgin Mary, Santa Maria Maggiore's newest resident will begin his rest.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrgzl0vyqpo
Five cards China holds in a trade war with the US,"From rare earths to billions in US debt, here's what China has in its arsenal - and how strong they are.",Asia,"World of Business, Trump tariffs, China",Koh Ewe,2025-04-23T21:50:09.046Z,2025-04-23T21:50:09.046Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f017/live/1a4c4200-1f2d-11f0-9612-0d839e1e9bdc.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f017/live/1a4c4200-1f2d-11f0-9612-0d839e1e9bdc.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kxe1m1y26o,"A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing.

Chinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would ""fight to the end"".

Here's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.

China is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.

With more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.

Beijing is still fumbling with the keys becauseChinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to""silver trains""for travelling retirees, that could change.

And Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.

The leadership may ""very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression"", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.

China also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.

Still, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.

The economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.

The Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to ""weather storms together"".

President Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: ""The sky will not fall.""

China has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.

Under Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance.

It has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI.

Examples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which wascelebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.

Recently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.

US companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.

Chinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.

That unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.

Ever since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order.

It has pumped billions into acontentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.

The expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.

American farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier.

""The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once‑captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,"" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute.

The US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.

That doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.

Following reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against""reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests"".

That would be animpossible choicefor much of the world

""We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],"" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.

Trump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to ""medicine"".

But he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.

Trump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".

So, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.

China also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.

Some argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a ""weapon"".

But experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.

Rather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.

China will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds ""only up to a point"", Dr Zhang says. ""China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.""

What China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.

China has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.

Beijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.

China accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

While Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.

In 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.

The fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.

""Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,"" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment,told the BBCpreviously.

""The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kxe1m1y26o
Southport: Dads running marathon say 'our girls will be with us',David Stancombe and Sergio Aguiar tell BBC daughters will be with them in spirit during London race.,UK,"Southport knife attacks, London Marathon, Fundraising","Claire Ryan, George Sandeman and Sarah Campbell",2025-04-24T04:45:07.654Z,2025-04-24T04:45:07.654Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/76d5/live/d54d35a0-2068-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/76d5/live/d54d35a0-2068-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99pkz519g2o,"Two dads whose daughters were killed at a dance class in Southport last year have told the BBC how their children will be with them in spirit as they run the London Marathon.

David Stancombe and Sergio Aguiar are raising money for projects established in their daughters' memory.Alice Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, died last Julywhile they attended a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.

Mr Aguiar tells BBC Breakfast he talks to Alice when he's running alone. ""I tell her to keep going with me, that we're going to do this together, you're going to be with me - always.""

Mr Stancombe says his daughter would be very proud of his efforts. The pair had watched coverage of the marathon on TV last year and she told him he should run the race in honour of her grandmother.

""A little bit of me was like, 'oh yeah, alright Els,'"" says Mr Stancombe. ""I just never thought I would be running it for these reasons.""

Bebe's parents, Lauren and Ben King, will both be at the marathon to support the pair, on Sunday.

""It is just incredible what they are both doing,"" says Mrs King. ""And we want to be a part of it every step of the way.""

Mrs King says it is important to the couple that they are at the roadside as they want to represent their daughter while David and Sergio, who are running in honour of their girls, are cheered towards the finish line.

""They were such wonderful, caring little children,"" she says. ""Even though none of them knew each other, they were all so similar. And I reckon they are just up there watching over us and looking out for us.""

Mr Stancombe is raising money for Elsie's Story,a charitable trust that makes grants to assist young peopleand support others in the Southport area.

""I keep saying Elsie and those other girls will live longer than us,"" says her mum, Jenni Stancombe. ""Elsie's Story and the work that we're doing in the community will continue [her legacy].""

She says the grants are for ""causes that will bring joy, happiness and support to children... Elsie wouldn't want it any other way"".

Mrs Stancombe says she chokes up at the thought of David crossing the finish line and imagining what their daughter's reaction would have been.

""She'd be shouting from the line, you'd hear her above everybody else,"" she tells us. ""She'd take his medal off him straight away.""

Mr Stancombe says around 40 friends and family will be in London to cheer him on, all wearing hoodies and t-shirts featuring the Elsie's Story logo.

""I've seen so many videos of people crying at the end of the London marathon and I can't imagine what that will be like,"" he says. ""But I want to enjoy the day. I want to do it for me and I want to do it for Elsie.""

Mrs Stancombe is certain her husband will complete the marathon, having witnessed his resilience and determination during training.

""I have absolutely no doubt, but I know it will be Elsie who'll be the one to carry him over that finish line.""

The 26.2 mile (42 km) route finishes on The Mall in central Londonand, like David, Mr Aguiar is committed to reaching it.

""Twenty-six miles, I've never done anything like that before. But for my girl, I would do 26 or 50 - whatever,"" he says. ""The pain doesn't matter, I'm going to do it.""

He is raising money to build a newplayground, including a performance stage and library, at Churchtown Primary School,where Alice was a pupil.

It will be dedicated to Alice and Bebe, who previously attended the school.

Alexandra Aguiar, Alice's mum, says her daughter would have loved to see ""her friends play on the playground that [bears] her name"".

""The fact her name will be overlooking the playground forever, that would make her feel special,"" she says. ""And [I'm sure it's the] same for Bebe.""

Mrs King agrees, saying the new playground is a fitting tribute. ""It's really special that all [Bebe's] friends from that school will have this lasting legacy of her,"" she says.

""She'd be over the moon that she could bring some happiness to her friends and the kids of Churchtown.""

Ms Aguiar also feels her daughter will be accompanying her dad in spirit during the marathon. ""She's always with us. And she's going to be there helping daddy.""

She says she knows how Alice would have celebrated his efforts: ""She would have made a big thing of it and told everyone. She would also bring her shopping list to do after the marathon!""

Running alongside Mr Aguiar will be Jinnie Payne, the headteacher of Churchtown Primary School.

She says she has been struck by his courage to run and focus on the playground project.

""His determination [and] his resilience give me so much strength,"" says Ms Payne. The project, she says, is ultimately about Southport remembering the girls.

Mrs Stancombe and Ms Aguiar will be at the marathon to support their husbands. However, both say it will be their daughters - not them - who helps them cross the finish line.

How Northamptonshire became a warehouse and 'mega sheds' capital,"Real estate experts say online shopping is driving demand for more, and often larger, warehouses.",England,"Corby, Retailing, Logistics",Jon Ironmonger,2025-04-24T04:29:16.273Z,2025-04-24T04:29:16.273Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8b08/live/b2e38930-1ba7-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8b08/live/b2e38930-1ba7-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewg415g0kgo,"Bang in the middle of England, Northamptonshire has more storage and distribution centres than anywhere else in the country.

Corby, for example, is home to dozens of towering ""mega-sheds"", including Europa's worldwide HQ and Nike's forthcoming logistics campus.

But real estate experts say the current crop is just the start, and the UK will need the equivalent of more than 2,000 football pitches of extra warehouse space to keep up with house-building targets and the growth of online retail.

The head of the UK Warehousing Association insisted warehouses were an ""important engine of growth"" and said several recent constructions near to people's home were the result of a ""broken planning system"".

Speak to people in Corby town centre about warehouses and a theme soon emerges.

""I think they're disgusting,"" one woman said, ""an eyesore - I know we need them, but people have got their houses right next door.""

""We've got enough now"" another woman tells me, ""put them somewhere else.""

That may be wishful thinking.



Will Laing, a research analyst at Newmark Group, a specialist in commercial real estate, said warehouses in Northamptonshire are likely to keep getting bigger, as occupiers seek to expand and improve performance.

""We are seeing trade flows from the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk increase significantly, and these trade flows naturally go into the golden logistics triangle (an area of the East Midlands).

""Having a larger warehouse there allows for occupiers to reach the vast majority of consumers, and provides a central base for their other logistics networks.""

More homes mean more warehouses on the horizon, he said.

""On average, 69 sq ft (6.4 sq m) of warehouse space is needed to service each new home,"" said Mr Laing.

""Given the government's target to build 1.5 million homes in the next five years, coupled with the continued shift to online retail, we estimate 150,000,000 sq ft (13,935,456 sq m) of extra warehousing will be needed over the next 10 years.""

That's the equivalent of 2,160 football pitches, or about 1,500 large warehouses measuring 100,000 sq ft (9,290 sq m).

The warehouse-dotted landscape in Northamptonshire has provoked anger from some communities.

There have been thousands of objections to a proposed distribution siteon farmland near Thrapstonand a recently approved DHL logistics hubon the outskirts of Towcester.

Elsewhere, in Corby, those opposed to living in the shadow of an 18m (59ft) warehouse on the site of the former Weetabix plant wererecently refused a judicial review.

However, a judge said the council had ""fallen well below the standard expected"" by failing to consult residents properly after distributing notices to the wrong street.

The warehouse in question, Rockingham 161, is currently vacant and taking bids from occupiers with the promise of bringing hundreds of jobs to the local area.

It'sa similar story for villagers in Nactonnear Ipswich, who told the BBC a ""mega-shed"" near their homes, the size of six football pitches, had brought them to tears.

Neighbours have described the warehouse as a ""monstrosity"" and ""the wrong development, in the wrong location"".

But not everyone agrees warehouses are an eyesore.

""I love them"" says Clare Bottle, chief executive ofthe UK Warehousing Association.

""If I had one at the bottom of my garden, I would genuinely not be disappointed, because I think they look majestic and wonderful.

""But there is a bigger story here, because poorly located warehouses are a symptom of our broken planning system.

""Those areas with warehouses near homes in Corby and Nacton have been nominated as industrial land, so it's easier to get planning permission, and we're finding in East Anglia there just isn't enough industrial land.""

However, that could soon change undergovernment reforms to planning policy, which are the subject of a public consultation.

The measures would allow more areas of the green belt to be defined as grey belt, making them suitable for commercial development.

Ministers insist logistics is one of the key industries the reforms will aim to support.

""We're not building warehouses for the sake of it,"" Mrs Bottle said. ""We're building them because they're an important engine of growth in our supply chains these days, and that's good for everyone.

""We're more reliant on the service sector than ever before, and we're relying on goods being as close to the supply chain as possible.""

Despite public objections to more warehousing, the industry has been growing largely due to a shift in people's spending habits.

Official figuresshow internet sales as a percentage of total retail has risen steadily over the past 20 years and now stands at about 27%, with consumers expecting ever quicker deliveries or returns.

Clare Newton, commercial director atWarehouse Space, a storage rental service, says people need to get used to warehouses.

""What human beings have got to appreciate is if they're buying stuff online and want it tomorrow, then guess what, it's going to a warehouse near you.

""Eight per cent of the UK population is employed in logistics, and all of them are running around to make people's lives cheaper and easier.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewg415g0kgo
Runcorn by-election battle tests Labour nerves,The by-election on 1 May will also be seen as a measure of the broader political mood that could set the tone in Westminster.,Politics,,Alex Forsyth,2025-04-24T12:30:54.880Z,2025-04-24T12:30:54.880Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6ea0/live/63cc86f0-20f5-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6ea0/live/63cc86f0-20f5-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74n749zlqwo,"In a quiet corner of Runcorn, a group of residents who've been fighting to bring a disused canal back to use have found themselves thrust into the centre of a political battle.

The Unlock Runcorn group have long wanted to reconnect the Bridgewater and Manchester Ship canals, restoring what was an important water route that linked Runcorn with both Manchester and Liverpool and played a key part in the town's industrial boom.

The charity wants to reopen the canal as a regeneration project – and recently they've had a lot of attention from politicians, not least the parties vying for votes in the upcoming by-election.

""There are good places in Runcorn, there's so much going on, and it sometimes gets overlooked which is a real shame,"" says Stephen J Holloran, the group's community engagement officer.

""I think what the by-election is really doing is shining a spotlight and causing a debate.""

The attention thrust on the Cheshire constituency of Runcorn and Helsby is a sign of the high stakes in this by-election, which was triggered by theresignation of the former Labour MP Mike Amesbury.

He was handed a 10-week prison term after punching a constituent in Frodsham, Cheshire. It was reduced to a suspended sentence after an appeal.

The constituency combines the industrial town of Runcorn, sitting on the banks of the River Mersey, with a more rural area stretching south towards Chester.

It's a relatively new seat, formed by boundary changes ahead of last year's general election, but Labour still won comfortably in an area that's considered one of the party's strongholds in the North West of England.

But Reform UK placed second in 2024 – and now they have the constituency firmly in their sights as they try to show their momentum isn't limited to opinion polls.

The party's set up a visible office in the middle of a shopping centre in Runcorn, emblazoned with branding, and is trying to tap into a sense of political disillusionment with other parties.

At the Heath Business Park - a hub for businesses that also has community facilities - Catherine Chadwick is at a weekly get-together for the over-50s.

In her view, the town's pensioners are among those who can feel overlooked.

""We fought the war and everything else and this country needs to start looking after their own people,"" she said.  ""We want someone that will do something for Runcorn.

""More for the younger ones to do instead of getting into trouble. They need places to go. And more bobbies on the beat….and the NHS. Definitely the NHS needs fixing.""

Both national and local issues have come up in this campaign, from tolls on local bridges and the regeneration of the high street to health, housing, the cost of living and immigration – with a lot of focus on alocal hotel that's been used to house asylum seekers.

Anthony Stonebanks, who runs a café and events space at the Heath Business Park, cites illegal immigration as one of the issues on his mind - along with facilities for young people and a lack of funding in the area.

But his biggest concern is whether any party has the answers.

""I think working class people are sort of neglected, where it's like we're going to put all these things in place and they don't see it through,"" he said.

""Obviously certain areas around Runcorn are quite deprived. They look at these areas and say we're going to do this and we're going to do that…but they need to back it up.""

It's a familiar refrain from those who feel elections can bring attention and promises, without always yielding results.

Outside the town of Runcorn, the constituency becomes more rural, and the political landscape changes too.

Before the seat was reconfigured, some of the villages sat in areas held by the Conservatives before 2017 and the party's fighting this by-election with the hope of showing it can still command support.

On the top of Helsby Hill, members of the Helsby Running Club are limbering up for a cross-country run with a view of the whole constituency spread below.

The club's head coach, John Whitehead, points out local landmarks that epitomise his frustration, from a disused railway he says could improve connectivity to the community sports centre which is much-loved and well used, but struggles for funding.

""I think British politics feels broken at the moment and everyone's sort of pulling in from big political parties and saying a lot of lip service, and I really don't think a big political party can get to grips with local issues,"" he says.

There are a total of 15 candidatesvying for votes in Runcorn and Helsby on 1 May, with representatives from the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party among them.

When the results roll in, it won't just have an impact on the people who live in the area.

This is the first parliamentary by-election since Keir Starmer took power, and in a seat that had been considered safe for Labour the result will be an important measure of the party's support after less than a year in government.

A bad result could set party nerves jangling.

Reform UK wants to show they can knock a brick out of Labour's so-called ""red wall"", with Nigel Farage keen to prove the party's electoral credibility with a win in the North West of England.

The Conservatives are among those who'll be watching closely to see how the insurgent party performs in an election which will be affected by local factors, but will also be seen as a measure of the broader political mood that could set the tone in Westminster.

'My peanut allergy nearly killed me - now I eat them every day',"Just a few years ago, Chris Brookes-Smith could have died from eating peanuts - but taking part in a clinical trial has changed his life.",Health,"Food allergies, Health, Allergies",Philippa Roxby,2025-04-23T23:03:24.765Z,2025-04-23T23:03:24.765Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4915/live/0f5b9600-20e7-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4915/live/0f5b9600-20e7-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpvzrjjdzo,"Chris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut.

Ten years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory.

""I knew I was in trouble after one bite,"" he says. ""Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.""

His voice tails off, full of emotion.

""I thought I was going to die.""

Photos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body.

""I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,"" Chris says.

But the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt ""like boiling water had been poured over me"".

Trying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety.

As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.

An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals.Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious.

Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.

Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day ""on high alert hoping nothing bad happens"".

Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.

Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.

As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.

It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.

Despite being ""really nervous"", Chris agreed to sign up.

Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.

By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.

Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment ""has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives"".

""Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.

""They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.""

The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostlyin childrenwhose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.

""Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,"" says Prof Till. ""Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.""

This trial, published in the journal Allergy,shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.

Chris, who lives in Northamptonshire, had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine.

""The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,"" he says. ""The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.""

But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.

""You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.""

However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.

Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.

""For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,"" explains Prof Till. ""But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.""

Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.

How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.

And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.

Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay – as recommended by his doctors.

He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.

While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into ""nuclear meltdown"" has changed his life.

""It's a wonderful feeling,"" Chris says. ""I'm no longer afraid of dying.""

"Why are energy bills going up, if there is more green power?","The government has pledged to reduce energy bills by using more renewables, but bills are currently rising.",N/A,"Electricity pricing, Ed Miliband, Renewable energy",Mark Poynting,2025-02-07T16:41:22.853Z,2025-04-24T09:15:15.024Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3fb1/live/02bceb80-e54e-11ef-a819-277e390a7a08.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3fb1/live/02bceb80-e54e-11ef-a819-277e390a7a08.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkep1vx3mro,"Energy bills rose by 6% for a typical family in April,following an announcement from the regulator Ofgem.

But Labour pledged in its manifesto: ""We will save families hundreds of pounds on their bills, not just in the short term, but for good."" It also promised bills would come down by ""up to £300 by 2030"".

Responding to the 6% price cap rise, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it was due to ""our reliance on the fossil fuel markets"" and added: ""We're acting to bring down bills for everyone with our mission for clean, home-grown power that we control.""

The government wants to remove nearly all fossil fuels from UK electricity production by 2030.

More power is coming from renewable sourcesthan ever before, so why isn't this translating into cheaper electricity bills?

There are a number of reasons, including the time and money it takes to make the power system greener, the question of who pays, and the way the electricity market is set up.

The UK's electricity is expensive.

Compared with countries in the European Union, UK domestic electricity prices ranked fourth highest in the first half of 2024 - the most recent government data.

This is for consumers with medium usage, including taxes and subsidies.

For industrial electricity, the UK had the highest prices - for medium users - over the same period.

The UK hasmuch higher electricity prices- both domestic and industrial - than other large economies outside Europe, such as the US and Canada.

The largest, and most variable, component of a UK customer's electricity bill is the ""wholesale"" price. This is the cost at which suppliers buy it from the companies that generate it.

Other parts of the bill include ""network"" costs for operating, maintaining and upgrading the power grid, and ""policy"" costs, which include government levies to help fund environmental projects.

The main reason for the spikes in electricity bills over the past few years has been changes to wholesale costs. This is linked to an increase in international gas prices.

The price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of electricity.

Once built, the cost of generating power from renewables is very low, so these typically come in with the cheapest bid. Nuclear might come next.

Gas generators often have the highest costs, because they have to buy gas to burn, as well as paying a ""carbon price"" - a charge for emissions.

The wholesale cost is set by the last unit of electricity needed to meet demand from consumers. This means that even if gas only generates 1% of power at a given time, gas will still set the wholesale price.

In Great Britain, this generally happensmore often than its European counterparts, where demand can be met more often without relying on gas.

""The main reason why electricity prices are currently high is because the cost of gas - which is what sets the electricity price - is also high,"" said a spokesperson from the Climate Change Committee, the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions.

Renewables can generate electricity cheaply.

But building a wind farm on land - and particularly out at sea - comes with high up-front costs and the planning process is often lengthy.

The government needs to triple wind and solar capacity. To get developers to deliver this, it needs to provide certainty that they will get a return on their investment.

It does that by agreeing a fixed price - or strike price - that they will be paid for each unit of electricity generated for 15 years into the future.

If the wholesale price is below this fixed price, the renewable generator gets paid a top up by a government-owned company. If the wholesale price is above the strike price, the generator pays the difference back.

Any costs or savings are then passed onto consumers via bills.

Strike prices were expensive, but have fallen considerably, apart from a small rise from 2022-24 linked to global supply chain pressures.

As more renewables are connected - and operational improvements mean the grid can be safely run on this type of power - there should be more times when gas is not setting the wholesale price.

""There are in practice very few hours at the moment in which gas does not set the price despite being a minority of the overall generation,"" said Adam Berman, director of policy at Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry.

""The more that you are able to have a renewable infrastructure that can deliver electricity at any hour of the day and in any circumstance, the more you are able to move away from gas setting the price.""

The UK has an ageing electricity grid, which needs upgrading, partly to accommodate new renewable power sources. There are times when wind power is actually paid not to generate, because the grid cannot handle all the electricity that it could produce.

This adds to the network costs in a bill.

Intermittent renewable sources also require backup for when it's not windy or sunny. In the short term, this role will be largely filled by gas, but eventually it could be met by storing renewable energy in batteries or by hydrogen power.

Great Britain's island location means it is more expensive than in continental Europe to build interconnectors - cables to connect electricity systems of neighbouring countries - to help meet periods of low output.

Some analysts have also argued that placing extra social and environmental taxes on electricity bills - rather than gas bills or general taxation - makes electricity artificially expensive.

The government is reviewing the structure of the electricity market, alongside its push for clean power through renewables and nuclear.

In the long term, renewables ""will be bringing down overall energy bills, and specifically electricity bills, for the UK,"" argues Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London.

But savings in the short term are not guaranteed. A faster rollout of renewables could mean upfront costs - for things like upgrading the grid - being passed onto consumers more quickly.

Some analysts have also expressed concern that a rush to secure enough renewables to meet the 2030 goal could mean less competitive ""strike prices"", locking in higher costs.

""If you think 10-15 years down the line, you are likely to see the cost for technologies like offshore wind decrease further… but potentially the rush to have to do this in the next couple of years means that you have to lock in a lot of these projects now to make sure that it can deliver [for 2030],"" said Pranav Menon, research associate at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.

""That does mean that you are going to push up against stretched supply chains, which could mean that cost to procure that [extra capacity] increases.""

But a rapid roll-out of renewables would also reduce the UK's dependence on gas - the main cause of the price spike of the past few years - and so there could be benefits sooner if gas prices remain high.

The government said earlier in February that its plans would ""bring down bills for households and businesses for good"" and lowering them by ""up to £300 by 2030"" remains an objective.

Hamas' iron grip on Gaza is slowly slipping as residents protest,"Gazan civilians are losing their fear of Hamas, openly criticising the group on the streets and online.",Middle East,"Israel-Gaza war, Gaza, Hamas",Paul Adams,2025-04-24T05:01:39.715Z,2025-04-24T05:01:39.715Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/96e8/live/ece5fb20-20e5-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/96e8/live/ece5fb20-20e5-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c175z14r8pro,"""Out! Out! Out!""

The voice in the Telegram video is insistent. Loud. Sometimes musical.

And the message unambiguous.

""All of Hamas, out!""

On the streets of Gaza,more and more Palestinians are expressing open defianceagainst the armed group that's ruled the strip for almost 20 years.

Many hold Hamas responsible for plunging the tiny, impoverished territory into the worst crisis faced by Palestinians in more than 70 years.

""Deliver the message,"" another crowd chants, as it surges through Gaza's devastated streets: ""Hamas is garbage.""

""The world is deceived by the situation in the Gaza Strip,"" says Moumen al-Natour, a Gaza lawyer and former political prisoner who's long been a vocal critic of Hamas.

Al-Natour spoke to us from the shattered remains of his city, the flimsy canvas side of the tent which now forms part of his house billowing behind him.

""The world thinks that Gaza is Hamas and Hamas is Gaza,"" he said. ""We didn't choose Hamas and now Hamas is determined to rule Gaza and tie our fate to its own. Hamas must retreat. ""

Speaking out is dangerous. Hamas has never tolerated dissent. Al-Natour seems undaunted, writing a furious column for the Washington Post at the end of March.

""To support Hamas is to be for Palestinian death,"" he wrote, ""not Palestinian freedom"".

Wasn't it dangerous to speak out in this way, I asked him.

""We need to take a risk and speak out,"" he replied without hesitation.

""I'm 30 years old. When Hamas took over, I was 11. What have I done with my life? My life has been wasted between war and escalating violence for nothing.""

Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 by violently ousting political rivals, a year after winning national elections, there have been three major wars with Israel and two smaller conflicts.

""Humanity demands that we raise our voices,"" al-Natour said, ""despite suppression by Hamas"".

Hamas may be busy fighting Israel, but it's not afraid to punish its critics.

At the end of March, 22-year old Oday al-Rubai was abducted by armed gunmen from a refugee shelter in Gaza City.

Hours later, his body was found covered in horrific wounds.

The Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights said Oday had been tortured, calling his death ""a grave violation of the right to life and an extrajudicial killing"".

Al-Rubai had participated in recent anti-Hamas protests. His family blamed Hamas for his death and demanded justice.

Days earlier, a frightened al-Rubai posted a dark, grainy video on social media in which he expressed his fear that Hamas militants were coming for him.

""Gaza has become a city of ghosts,"" he said, glancing over his shoulder.

""I'm stranded in the street, not knowing where to go. I don't know why they're after me. They destroyed us and brought ruin to us.""

At his funeral, a small crowd demanded revenge and repeated demands for Hamas to get out of Gaza.

Last summer,Amin Abed almost suffered the same fate, following his decision to speak out against Hamas.

Masked militants beat him senseless, broke bones all over his body and damaged his kidneys. Abed survived but had to seek medical treatment abroad.

Now living in Dubai, he's still involved in the protest movement, and believes that Hamas' authority is diminished.

""Hamas' power has begun to fade,"" he told me.

""It targets activists and civilians, beats and kills them to scare people. But it's not how it was before.""

Before the ceasefire collapsed last month, Hamas fighters seemed intent on highly visible displays of power.

But now, with Israel once again attacking relentlessly, the same gunmen have retreated underground and Gaza's civilians have been plunged back into the misery of war.

Some of the more recent protests suggest that civilians, driven to the edge of madness by a year and a half of Israeli bombardment, are losing their fear of Hamas.

Beit Lahiya, at the northern end of the Gaza Strip, has seen some of the most vociferous opposition.

In a series of voice notes, an eyewitness – who asked not to be named – described several recent incidents in which local residents prevented Hamas fighters from carrying out military actions from inside their community.

On 13 April, he said, Hamas gunmen tried to force their way into the house of an elderly man, Jamal al-Maznan.

""They wanted to launch rockets and pipes [a derogatory term used for some of Hamas' home-made projectiles] from inside his house,"" the eyewitness told us.

""But he refused.""

The incident soon escalated, with relatives and neighbours all coming to al-Maznan's defence. The gunmen opened fire, injuring several people, but eventually were driven out.

""They were not intimidated by the bullets,"" the eyewitness said of the protesters.

""They advanced and told [the gunmen] to take their things and flee. We don't want you in this place. We don't want your weapons that have brought us destruction, devastation and death.""

Elsewhere in Gaza, protesters have told militants to stay away from hospitals and schools, to avoid situations in which civilians are caught up in Israeli air strikes.

But such defiance is still risky. In Gaza City, Hamas shot one such protester dead.

With little to lose and hopes of an end to the war dashed once more, some Gazans direct their fury equally at Israel and Hamas.

Asked which side he blamed most for Gaza's catastrophe, Amin Abed said it was ""a choice between cholera and the plague"".

The protest movement of recent weeks is not yet a rebellion, but after almost 20 years of rule Hamas' iron grip on Gaza is slowly slipping.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c175z14r8pro
Laos methanol poisoning: 'Don't let it be your best friend',Bethany Clarke wants more done to educate people about the dangers of bootleg alcohol abroad.,Asia,Laos,Jack Gray,2025-04-24T13:08:28.235Z,2025-04-24T13:08:28.235Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a37a/live/5ccb41b0-20fb-11f0-b122-c52cf00da345.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a37a/live/5ccb41b0-20fb-11f0-b122-c52cf00da345.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27r2z0zveo,"The best friend of a woman who died from methanol poisoning on holiday has called on the government to do more to educate teenagers in schools about the dangers of drinking alcohol abroad.

Bethany Clarke was travelling in Laos in south-east Asia with childhood friend Simone White when they drank free shots they were offered in a hostel in November.

The following day, they both became unwell and initially thought they had food poisoning. But, a few days later, 28-year-old Simone died in hospital.

The Foreign Office and Department for Education have been contacted for a comment about Bethany's petition.

Simone, who was from Orpington in south-east London, and Bethany planned to stay in Cambodia for just under two weeks, and spend four days in Laos.

They fell ill after drinking six vodka shots served to them at the Nana Backpackers hostel in traveller hotspot Vang Vieng.

Five other tourists also died after drinking at the hostel.

Their drinks are thought to have contained methanol - a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol.

Medical specialists say drinking as little as 25ml of methanol can be fatal, but it is sometimes added to drinks because it is cheaper than alcohol.

But Bethany, 28, tells BBC Newsbeat they didn't even realise anything was wrong until the next day.

""This all happened on the fourth day of the trip. We did the tubing that day and that was good,"" she says.

""It's difficult to obviously describe the timeline. I think when I realised it was all going wrong was when we were on the kayaks for a trip we were doing the following morning. So just over 12 hours on.

""I guess that was when me and Simone were flat on the back of these kayaks, not being able to use our arms. We were just literally staring up into space.

""That was a moment where I thought I really don't understand what's happening to us. It just seemed like I was just having to accept my fate.""



Bethany says even when they tried to get help, it took them a while to be treated for methanol poisoning and they had to search for information about it themselves.

""The doctors kept saying it was food poisoning, which obviously didn't help with trying to treat what was going on,"" she says.

""This is when our other friends said 'let's get to a private hospital'. In the ambulance on the way there our friend mentioned to the paramedic 'could it be methanol poisoning?' He'd done a little bit of research on his phone.

""They rushed Simone off to have dialysis straight away and said to me 'look can you just sign these forms and we'll do our best to save her life?'

""And yeah, they did their best.""

Bethany says the group trusted the hostel because the reviews were good but she's now urging others to be careful.

""We didn't think we were doing anything stupid, but obviously now I do feel like I should have known more.

""The advice is from me 'steer clear, drink beer'. Look up the symptoms, be mindful about where you're drinking.

""Just don't let it be your best friend that dies from methanol poisoning.""

She's also set up a petition calling for the dangers of methanol poisoning to be put on the school curriculum.

It says ""children should be taught the dangers of consuming bootleg alcohol as part of the PSHE and/or Biology curriculum in school"".

""I think it just needs to be a five minute talk, or possibly even some kind of public health advert, just giving the case study of Laos and saying this can happen,"" she says.

""If people want to take the risk and drink it, at least they've been educated, and then they might even be able to spot some of the symptoms if they do happen to drink it.""

Bethany is currently working in Australia and has since made a full recovery.

She says Simone was ""so full of life, energetic, sporty, musical - there's 100 adjectives I could probably come up with"".

""She was just the best friend that anybody could hope for.

""If you ever had a problem she'd always be trying to help you with it and she was just such a good listener.""

Police watchdog complains to Ofcom over BBC's Panorama on Chris Kaba ,The Chris Kaba episode initially aired without the IOPC's response to claims made by an ex-employee.,UK,"Chris Kaba shooting, Metropolitan Police Service",Paul Glynn,2025-04-24T11:58:18.293Z,2025-04-24T11:58:18.293Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8263/live/80dffa80-20e4-11f0-9b17-b99e39a28c13.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8263/live/80dffa80-20e4-11f0-9b17-b99e39a28c13.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr783gxve9go,"A police watchdog has complained to Ofcom over an episode of Panorama about the shooting of Chris Kaba.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) went to the broadcasting watchdog after its request for a public apology from the BBC went unmet, after the programme initially aired without including the IOPC's statement in response toclaims made by its own former regional director Sal Naseem.

A BBC spokeswoman said the corporation's own Executive Complaints Unit (ECU)rulinghad judged the complaint to be ""resolved"" after it had been accepted as an oversight not to include the IOPC's point of view; the iPlayer version and online article were quickly amended.

Mr Kaba was shot dead after he tried to ram his way out of a police vehicle stop in south London in September 2022.

Sgt Martyn Blake, an officer in the specialist firearms unit MO19, was found not guilty of murder in October last year, prompting protests from the Kaba family.

Speaking after the verdict at the Old Bailey, Mr Kaba's family said it was ""painful proof that our lives are not valued by the system"".

Mr Naseem told BBC Panorama that in his opinion, he had not been convinced that Mr Kaba presented a sufficient danger to justify being shot.

He suggested that the murder investigation into Mr Blake was launched amid pressure over potential unrest, which is denied by the IOPC.

The IOPC complained that the programme did not make clear that Mr Naseem no longer works for the watchdog, and that it was not given the proper right to reply to the claims over why the investigation was launched.

In the programme, Mr Naseem said that when the IOPC launched its homicide investigation four days after the shooting, ""It was fed back to us... that if we hadn't done it at that time then it's likely there would have been a level of disorder.""

The IOPC's statement denying this was added to the iPlayer version of the Panorama episode and online news stories.

The statement read: ""The decisions to criminally investigate Sergeant Blake, and then refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), followed careful consideration of a significant amount of evidence gathered during our independent investigation and by applying the relevant legal tests which govern our work.""

According to the BBC complaint unit's judgement, Panorama should have provided the IOPC with specific information about the claims to be made about it, and therefore found an element of unfairness to the IOPC.

However it noted the programme makers had taken subsequent action to include the organisation's right to reply in the iPlayer version and related online article, which was deemed ""sufficient to resolve this aspect of the complaint.""

But the IOPC said on Thursday it had complained to Ofcom because it was ""hugely dissatisfied that, despite admitting these two breaches of its own guidelines, the BBC has steadfastly refused to apologise publicly despite the IOPC providing evidence to show the serious reputational damage caused to the organisation as a result of the programme.

""In particular, the suggestion within that programme, that the IOPC was pressured to start a homicide investigation, was wrong and resulted in public criticism from a number of media organisations and individuals including concerns raised by the London Assembly and local councillors about the IOPC's independence and motivations.

""Had we been aware this would be suggested, we would have strongly refuted it.""

Mr Naseem said in the Panorama that he fully accepted the jury's verdict, but stood by the IOPC's decision to refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

Universal UK: Century-long plans made for Bedford theme park,"President of new ventures, Page Thompson, says the theme park is just the start of local investment.","Beds, Herts & Bucks","Bedford, Stewartby, Universal Studios UK, Theme parks, Kempston Hardwick",Danny Fullbrook,2025-04-24T04:24:48.361Z,2025-04-24T04:24:48.361Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f791/live/47446c10-2059-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f791/live/47446c10-2059-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrg95rp5wo,"A new theme park is ""just the start"" of Universal's century-long plans for its UK site, the company's president has said.

The US firmbought a former brickworks near Bedfordwhich it plans to transform into a 476-acre attraction that will draw in 8.5 million annual visitors by 2031.

""We look at these projects as really long-term projects,"" said Page Thompson, president of new ventures at Universal Destinations & Experiences, speaking for the first time since the announcement.

""We try to think about the next 100 years.""

He added: ""We have a lot more land that we intend to develop... in ways that bring more people to the area and hopefully is beneficial for everybody.

""Phase one of this project is the theme park, a 500-room hotel, some restaurants that people can visit without buying a theme park ticket.

""This is just the start of the development in the Bedford area on our land that we're going to own.""

Universal theme parks already exist in America, China, Singapore and Japan.

Mr Thompson insisted that the UK attraction would be the only Universal site in Europe - and not the first of many.

""This is probably our real destination in Europe, and we do expect to draw from all over Europe,"" he said.

""In fact, we expect in our first year that about 30% of our visitors will come from outside of the UK. So we think we're going to be a major driver for tourism to the country.

""A country with the population and the tourist visitation of the UK should have probably three of the top 25 theme parks in the world.

""Right now they don't have any - and our smallest park that we operate anywhere in the world draws nine million people.

""So we feel very confident that demand is there.""

Before choosing to build at the former brickworks, the company had considered other locations across Europe.

Mr Thompson described Kempston Hardwick as ""the perfect site for us"".

""It's just a fantastic location, and the site was flat and already slated for development, and we knew from the very beginning we had incredibly strong support from the people in Bedford.""

The government's decision to backEast West Railand Luton Airport's expansion plans were positive factors, the firm said.

Mr Thompson was not worried when it was pointed out East West Rail was not expected to be completed until the 2030s - andLuton Airport's annual passenger target of 32 million was set for 2043.

""The Oxford link to our site on the East West Rail should be completed by 2030,"" he said.

""Already London Luton Airport is drawing 18 million passengers a year. So the recent news about their planning approval for the expansion is just an extra bonus for us as well.""

The nearest access road, the A421,suffered severe flooding last yearafter heavy rainfall, but this did not faze the Orlando-based executive.

""We have plans to work on the access ramp from the A421 directly into our site, and we will be addressing some of the issues you mentioned on that.""

During construction, Universal is expecting to create 20,000 jobs, with a peak of about 5,000 workers on site.

It estimates that 80% of those jobs will come from Bedford, central Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes.

The company does not expect to struggle to fill those roles and is working to ensure jobs are available for local people.

Mr Thompson said: ""We'll work with all of the local colleges, universities, and schools to try to make sure that we can help develop the skills that we need to attract those people.

""The reason we went to Kimberley College and to Bedford College for our public meetings was to emphasise how we want to work with those institutions and others to develop curricula that helps create the jobs.

""We've done a lot of research on both the number of people during the construction period and the number of people during operations, and we believe that in Bedford and the surrounding boroughs and the surrounding area, that we will have no trouble drawing that number of people.""

He said half of the management team based in Orlando started as hourly workers and there would be similar opportunities for career development for the young people of Bedford.

Mr Thompson said he expected the theme park would be ""transformational"" for the Bedford area.

He explained that at other parks, tourists had travelled from around the world, stayed in nearby hotels and made use of local amenities.

""We want people to stay overnight, because that's really a beautiful area,"" he said.

""I think people coming from London will come out and have a little bit of a staycation there for the weekend.

""There's quite a lot of fun things to do in the surrounding area, so I think, and that will only grow.

""I think we'll see more hotels, and I think there are many local businesses that are going to benefit from the park because we don't do everything ourselves.

""Whether it's a local bakery, electrician, plumber security services, construction people -  there's just going to be ongoing work on the site. And we're going to be outsourcing a lot of that work to the local community. ""

The company confirmed planning documents would be submitted to the government ""in the next couple of months"", with construction still targeted to start in 2026.

Mr Thompson smiled when asked if those documents could include hints at what film franchises would inspire attractions at the park.

""We've had a lot of speculation about what's in the park,"" he said. ""We always enjoy the speculation.

""We think it's very entertaining to see what people would like to see and what they expect to see in the park.

""But we won't comment on the specific properties or lands in the park until we get a lot closer to opening.""

He paid tribute to the people of the borough, adding: ""This project would not be happening if it weren't for the enthusiasm of the people in the Bedford area.

""They deserve incredible thanks from us for their support at every stage of the project.""

Bereaved parents demand social media firms 'protect children',Four families who believe social media had a role in the death of their children are protesting in New York. ,Technology,"Social media, TikTok",Jon Kay,2025-04-24T12:07:07.899Z,2025-04-24T12:41:13.847Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/98b4/live/fe449d90-2108-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/98b4/live/fe449d90-2108-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn3gnee77o,"A group of British parents who believe social media played a part in the death of their children have travelled to the US to demand better online safety protections for children.

Four families flew to New York City to take part ina protest with hundreds of other parents outside the offices of Meta - owner of Facebook and Instagram.

""All we're asking for is can you please help us protect our children,"" said Mark Kenevan, father of Isaac who died aged 13 from taking part in a social media challenge.

Their visit comes as media regulator Ofcom announced that websites will belegally required to block children's access to harmful contentfrom July to continue operating in the UK.

Websites will also have to introduce more rigorous age checks, according to its final children's code of practice published on Thursday.

BBC Breakfast followed the four British families on their mission in the US.

Lisa Kenevan, mother of Isaac, said the families banding together had given each other strength.

""We just want government, we want tech companies to understand that we are getting stronger, our voices are getting stronger, and we're not going to go away,"" she said.

A coroner ruled that Isaac had died in 2022 as a result of misadventure, but the Kenevans say social media platforms were also to blame.

This year they were among several families who filed awrongful death lawsuit against TikTokin the US, which accuses the platform of pushing dangerous prank and challenge videos to children to boost engagement time.

Maia Walsh's family, who are part of the lawsuit, also believe the 13-year-old died from injuries while taking part inanonline challenge. Aninquest into her death will examine her use of TikTok.

Her father Liam Walsh, talking about the New York protest, told BBC Breakfast: ""I feel as though we're getting recognition for what happened to our children, because there is something in it - it's not just desperate parents clutching at straws.

""We're slowly revealing what happened to our children, and this is part of that movement.""

TikTok says it prohibits dangerous content or challenges on the platform, and directs those who search for hashtags or videos to its safety centre.

Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, says it also shares the goal of keeping teens safe online and had recently introduced ""teen accounts"" with enhanced protections.

""We believe teens deserve consistent protections across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms,"" Meta said in a statement.

Also among the parents in New York is Ellen Roome, who believes her 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died after an online challenge went wrong in 2022 and his social media accounts could provide the evidence needed. An inquest into his death found he took his own life.

""[He was] just a normal, lovely boy. Not one moment in our life did we think we would be in this position... there was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem,"" Ms Roome said, who is campaigning for legislation to grant parents access to their children's social media accounts if they die.

""I almost want to tell parents 'you don't know what your children are looking at'.

""This isn't for our children because it's too late, but for them to have that conversation with their children about what are they looking at, what are they seeing.""

The BBC previously approached TikTok, X, Snapchat, Discord and Meta - which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads - to ask about Ms Roome's case.

None of them gave a formal response, but a spokesperson from Snapchat previously said: ""Our hearts go out to Ms Roome and her family for the loss of Jools.

""We have extra protections for under 18s and offer parental tools so parents can see who their teens are communicating with and report any concerns.""

A spokesperson for TikTok has also previously said the company had removed 99% of videos showing or promoting dangerous content before it was reported by a user.

Also among the parents in New York was Lorin LaFave, mother of 14-year-oldBreck Bednar who was lured to his deathin 2014 after being groomed online whilst gaming.

The online safety campaigner, who now shares Breck's story in schools through the Breck Foundation, said: ""I would love to see age restrictions. For me I think children need their childhood longer.

""They're being exposed to so much adult content and adult relationships too soon, too young, and you're only a child once.""

On Wednesday night Ms Roome and Mrs Kenevan also met with some grieving American families, who they will join forces with to protest against the tech industry and to campaign for a safer online world.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn3gnee77o

Jamie Kadolski, of Ladysmith Road, Norwich, was found guilty of committing nine sexual offences against three women in the space of 13 months.

One of his victims said she was a ""shadow of who I once was"" and had tried to take her own life. Judge Anthony Bate said 25-year-old Kadolski still had ""no insight into the gravity"" of his offending.

At Norwich Crown Court, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison, with a further three years on extended licence, and was also made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order.

The court previously heard how the former East of England Ambulance Service call-handler had told the women he was a paramedic.

Prosecutors told the jury heused stickers on his work ID cardto hide his more junior role.

Kadolski was found guilty of three counts of rape and three sexual offences against one woman, and a total of three sexual offences against two others.

The offending was said to have happened between August 2022 and September 2023.

He was found not guilty of charges related to a fourth woman.

One of Kadolski's victims said they felt they could not tell their family about what had happened.

In a victim impact statement, they said they still had ""vivid flashbacks"" and experienced nightmares ""almost every night"" that he was going to break into their house and rape them.

A second woman said she had tried to take her own life, describing herself as a ""shadow of who I once was"".

Another victim said they blamed themselves for what had happened and ""still do to this day"".

The judge said the defendant ""projected a misleading impression of your healthcare professional status through your misuse of uniforms, health service identity cards and related papers"".

""Each of them [victims] expected to be safe in your company and able to enjoy a healthy and fulfilling future relationship based on mutual respect,"" he said.

He described Kadolski as a ""dangerous offender"" who continued to pose a ""high threat to women"".

The jury previously heard that when questioned by police, Kadolski said hewould not be able to pin someone downas he had been ""sexually abused as a child"".

He told officers when interviewed: ""I'm not the best with empathy or sympathy.""

Michael Cohen, for the defendant, said ""others are representing Mr Kadolski in an application for permission to appeal"" against the convictions.

The East of England Ambulance Service said Kadolski was ""immediately"" suspended when it was alerted of his arrest.

A spokesperson said: ""We are appalled at the crimes that Jamie Kadolski has been sentenced for today.

""Our thoughts are with the victims and all those affected by these horrific crimes. We recognise the courage it takes to come forward and speak out.""

Det Con Claire Floyd, from Norfolk Police, said the victims had ""suffered truly traumatic ordeals at Jamie Kadolksi's hands"".

""Although no sentence can ever make up for what happened to these women, I hope that today's result can give some sense of comfort that this dangerous and manipulative sexual predator will be in prison for a significant amount of time.""

Vehicles to be freed from car park after two years,It is thought up to 40 vehicles have been trapped in a building complex car park since December 2022.,London,"London, City of Westminster",James W Kelly & Matt Graveling ,2025-04-24T05:11:52.581Z,2025-04-24T11:57:38.313Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f735/live/6ae80c60-206a-11f0-82ef-73284b78c058.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f735/live/6ae80c60-206a-11f0-82ef-73284b78c058.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20z46p0p6jo,"Vehicles trapped in a central London mechanical stacked car park are being released after more than two years.

An email, seen by BBC London, has been sent to vehicle owners by the management company for Rathbone Square, CBRE. It said three-hour slots would be available from Thursday until 23 May for collections to be facilitated.

Small business co-owners Mark Lucas and Steve Davies, whose then-new Vauxhall Vivaro van became trapped in the building complex near Oxford Street in December 2022, said the saga had left them more than £46,000 out of pocket.

CBRE declined to comment on what caused the car park malfunction and whether owners could claim for financial losses.

A resident in the Rathbone Square development told BBC London up to 40 vehicles might be trapped. CBRE did not respond when asked to confirm this number.

A stacked car park is a system in which cars are parked on top of each other, using mechanical platforms and lifts, in order to make best use of the available space.

The email sets out the ""step-by-step guide to vehicle retrieval"" and states the ""car stacker will remain closed to all vehicles, to allow vehicle owners time to retrieve their vehicles"".

Mr Davies, co-owner of HCS Furniture in Buckinghamshire, said it had been a ""long time coming"" but he and his business partner were ""very excited"" to be collecting the van - however, he is unsure what condition its battery will be in.

""We're going to get it low-loaded so that we can get it back to our place to make sure it's OK, rather than risk driving it in whatever state it is in,"" he said.

""The first thing we're going to do is is take it down to the Vauxhall garage that we got it from so that they can service it and do a diagnostic test on the battery and to find out if it's suffered at all.""

The additional cost of renting the low-loader lorry and servicing the van will need to be assessed before the business can put in a final claim, Mr Davies said.

Lauren Kennedy, a mechanic based in Finchley, said the owners could find their vehicles in varying conditions.

""They're definitely going to have flat batteries, that's for sure. But they're also going to possibly have flat tyres, perished tyres, seized brakes.""

People with keyless systems may also struggle to get into their car if the batteries are flat.

Ms Kennedy said the drivers will probably need recovery teams with them to get their vehicles out and transported home.



Derek Millard-Smith, a solicitor specialising in parking law, said as well as any direct monetary costs incurred, the owners may also be able to claim for the inconvenience caused and ""loss of enjoyment"" of their vehicles.

""It's quantifying that time, which is the nature of any civil claim that you'd have to set out what you think your losses were,"" he said.

""And it is for the other side to say that they weren't that much if they didn't want to pay that much out.""

Double Parking Systems, which did not install but maintains the automated system at Rathbone Square, confirmed to the BBC last week that the parking system had been operational since 15 March.

Mr Davies said the whole experience had been ""dreadful"", in particular the poor communication they have had from CBRE.

""If they'd just communicated better and told us what was really happening, it wouldn't have been so traumatic,"" he said.

BBC London has contacted CBRE several times since early April but the firm would only confirm that the car park system was now fixed.

"Personal theft up 22% in England and Wales, ONS says",It is the highest number recorded in a year since the current data began in 2003.,UK,"Policing, Crime",Sofia Ferreira Santos,2025-04-24T12:56:50.779Z,2025-04-24T12:56:50.779Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1710/live/a1140f30-20f8-11f0-b0de-9db89039b2df.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1710/live/a1140f30-20f8-11f0-b0de-9db89039b2df.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crld4lgelp3o,"Personal thefts recorded by police in England and Wales were up 22% in 2024 from the previous year, according to official figures.

Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows police recorded 152,416 thefts from the person offences last year, the highest since the current data methods began in 2003.

Shoplifting was also on the rise, surpassing half a million recorded offences for the first time.

Meanwhile, the number of homicides was the lowest for a decade, and overall crime was still below pre-pandemic levels and down more than 75% since the mid-1990s.

There were also 54,587 knife crime offences recorded by police in 2024, up 2% from the previous year, while firearm offences decreased by 20%.

Overall, police recorded 6.64 million crimes in England and Wales last year - down 1% from 2023.

Responding to the data, policing minister Dame Diana Johnson said the government ""will not tolerate the criminality blighting our communities"".

She added: ""That's why we're putting almost 3,000 more bobbies on the beat in neighbourhood roles this year.""

To build a bigger picture of crime in England and Wales, the ONS also refers to estimates from its crime survey.

The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is a face-to-face survey which asks people aged 16 and over about their experiences of crime in the past year.

It estimated that there were 9.6 million incidents of what is described as ""headline crime"" in 2024 - which includes theft, robbery, criminal damage, fraud, computer misuse, and violence with or without injury.

Thelatest CSEW surveyreported that at the end of 2024:

Meanwhile, ONS data showed no significant change in people's experience of violent crime, which remained at the lowest level since equivalent records began in 1981.

The ONS reported that, over the last 10 years, there has been an increase in sexual assault.

In the year to March last year, 2.6% of people aged 16 to 59 reported experiencing sexual assault, including attempts. Ten years earlier, the proportion was 1.5%.

There has been a fall in domestic abuse over the same period, with 5.4% of those aged 16-59 reporting they had experienced domestic abuse in the previous 12 months, down from 6.5% a decade earlier.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crld4lgelp3o

Jamie Vardy: Leicester City captain to leave club at  end of the season,Relegated Leicester City announce captain Jamie Vardy will leave the club at the end of the season. ,Leicester,,Sean Kearns,2025-04-24T11:03:26.437Z,2025-04-24T11:03:26.437Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/c19b/live/9e470eb0-2107-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/c19b/live/9e470eb0-2107-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czrveg7dg5xo,"Leicester City captain Jamie Vardy will leave the club at the end of the season but intends to continue his playing career.

Announcing the news on Thursday, the Foxes described Vardy as ""our greatest ever player"".

The 38-year-old striker, who joined in 2012 from non-league side Fleetwood Town, is the club's record Premier League scorer with 143, and in all competitions has scored 198 goals in 498 appearances.

Vardy scored 24 times in the 2015-16 Premier League campaign, helping Leicester to the first ever top-flight title in their history.

The former England international was also part of their 2021 FA Cup-winning side, when the Foxes beat Chelsea 1-0 at Wembley.

""To the fans of Leicester, I'm gutted that this day is coming, but I knew it was going to come eventually,"" Vardy said in a video posted by Leicester on social media.

""I've spent 13 unbelievable years at this club, with lots of success, and some downs, but the majority have all been highs.

""It's finally time to call it a day, which I'm devastated about, but I think the timing is right.

""Leicester will always, always have a massive place in my heart.""

He added: ""This isn't retirement. I want to keep on playing and doing what I enjoy most - scoring goals.

""I may be 38 but I still have the desire and ambition to achieve so much more.""

Leicester boss Ruud van Nistelrooy said Vardy had stuck with the club ""through thick and thin"", adding: ""He has achieved everything and now can go and enjoy these last years with his family.

""For his next manager, he is one of the most open and honest people I have met.

""He will tell you how he feels and what he is thinking. He isn't hard to manage.""

Vardy described the club's season as ""miserable"" and a ""total embarrassment"" after the Foxes were relegated earlier this month.

Leicester are 19th in the table, having collected 18 points from their 33 matches.

After helping the club back into the top flight during his second season in the Midlands, Vardy was then an instrumental figure in the side's 'great escape' in the 2014-15 campaign.

Bottom of the table at Christmas and with just four wins by the start of April, the Foxes seemed destined to return to the Championship.

But 22 points from their final nine matches helped Nigel Pearson's side complete the most unlikely of revivals.

If that was unlikely, then what followed was unfathomable.

Leicester, 5,000-1 outsiders at the start of the season, went on to win their first ever top-flight titleas they were crowned Premier League champions in 2015-16under the management of Claudio Ranieri.

Vardy was named the Premier League Player of the Season after scoring 24 times in 36 appearances, including a record-breaking run that saw him find the net in 11 consecutive league matches - a mark that still stands today.

Vardy would go on to score in the side's subsequent Champions League campaign and he was the winner of the Premier League Golden Boot in 2019-20 with 23 goals.

The forward became the first player in FA Cup history to appear in 13 of the 14 rounds of the competition when he played in the 2021 FA Cup final as the Foxes, managed by Brendan Rodgers,lifted the trophy for the first time in their history.

Vardy remained with the Foxes after their relegation from the Premier League in 2023.

He hit 18 goals in 35 matches in the Championship after being named club captain by Enzo Maresca, helping them to win the title 10 years after Vardy's first promotion with Leicester.

Vardy has featured in 31 of the east Midlands club's 33 Premier League matches this term, scoring seven times.

His final game at the King Power Stadium will be on 18 May, when the Foxes host Ipswich.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/czrveg7dg5xo
Virgil van Dijk: How Liverpool captain became world's best,"As Virgil van Dijk prepares to lift his second Premier League title with Liverpool, we look at how the 33-year-old centre-back learned from early setbacks to become one of the best in the world.",Liverpool,,Arthur Renard,2025-04-23T22:00:37.521Z,2025-04-23T22:00:37.521Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/c618/live/bf741ef0-1f92-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/c618/live/bf741ef0-1f92-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.png,https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cd9le3v7n8eo,"Suddenly he was back where it all began.

Last month Virgil van Dijk made a secret visit to his old Dutch club Willem II to bring back a youth football tournament.

He said: ""It's my way of giving back and helping nurture the next generation of world-class talent. This tournament gives rising stars the platform they need to take the next step towards their dreams.""

Fittingly, the next edition of the 'Virgil Legacy Trophy' in September will feature all of the clubs where Van Dijk played in his career, plus the likes of Arsenal, Manchester City and PSG.

And it was in Tilburg, a Dutch city in the southern province of North Brabant, where the current Liverpool captain gained invaluable insights about football and life.

As he prepares to lift his second Premier League title with Liverpool, we look at how the 33-year-old centre-back learned from early setbacks to become one of the best in the world.

Van Dijk joined Willem II's then-acclaimed academy in 2001 as a 10-year-old.

It was a club that had defied the odds just a few years earlier by finishing second in the Eredivisie in 1998-99 and reaching the Champions League.

Shortly after his arrival, Jan van Loon was installed as academy director.

""There was actually no striker who stood a chance against him,"" Van Loon said. ""He was physically strong and he had a natural talent to take balls off opponents at exactly the right moment.

""I remember in games we would sometimes say to him: 'Watch out Virgil, there is an opponent behind you.' He would be very relaxed, like: 'Yeah, OK, no worries.'

""I recall a game against Ajax, where he would mark their best player. We were saying 'make sure he doesn't touch any ball,' and that's exactly what Virgil would do.""

Yet there was still room for improvement,

Van Loon, added: ""So now and then he could come across as laconic, a bit too easy going. Maybe at times some youth managers even thought of him as lazy.""

That image was partly created by his timekeeping, as Van Dijk would sometimes arrive late for training sessions.

It even got to the point where some coaches wondered whether the young defender should remain at the club.

But when Van Loon took a closer interest in the young footballer, he also gained insight into Van Dijk's personal life.

He said: ""His parents were divorced and at times he had to look after his younger brother and sister. Sometimes he had to take them from school and make them lunch, before jumping on the bus to Willem II.

""That meant he could be late now and then, and if I asked him about the reasons he would always explain in detail what had happened.

""One time I remember his little brother had asked him for peanut butter on his bread, something he had to go and get in the supermarket - and subsequently he just missed the bus. That period has shaped him both as a human and footballer.""

Van Dijk's impressive performances finally saw him offered a chance to play for the second team, when he was playing for Willem's under-19s.

But on the day of the match he had to submit a report for school, which he hadn't completed. School was paramount for the club, so he risked missing his big break,

""I said to Virgil: 'Let's look for a solution together',"" Van Loon added. ""He was really popular with his classmates, not because he was a footballer but just as a human being.

""He asked a few of his peers and everything was done in time. Not that they wrote the assignment, but they did help him. The night before the game I got a message from the teacher saying everything was fine.

""That teacher also played his part. That's why I always say it takes a village to raise a child. You need several people around you to push you in the right direction.""

Van Loon, who also had a spell as head of coaching at Arsenal's academy, noticed how Van Dijk nurtured his people skills by recognising who could help him.

He said: ""He developed a skill to assemble people around him who would be best for his career. He would ask for extra attention from the best staff members, because he instinctively felt they could make him better.

""That was very special, I also saw that with players like Bukayo Saka and Frenkie de Jong, who was also in the academy of Willem II.

""At the club there was an exercise physiologist, who knew how to relate strength training to the role of centre-back. When exercises were finished, Virgil said: 'No, we'll continue for a while.' There you could see his inner drive, even though some other coaches had an impression that he was lazy.""

As a teenager, Van Dijk combined his time playing at the Willem II academy with a part-time job as a dishwasher.

But, despite growing in stature and switching from right-back to centre-back, not everyone was convinced by Van Dijk at Willem and clubs hesitated to offer him a first professional contract.

""Inside the club there wasn't a unanimous opinion about him and I think Virgil felt that, that the opinions of the technical people were divided,"" Van Loon said.

FC Groningen took the opportunity and signed a 19-year-old Van Dijk in 2010 - despite Willem finally making him an offer.

The defender felt his own club were late with their offer and opted to take a different path in his career.

He made his professional debut in May 2011 and impressed in his first full season the year after - until serious illness stopped him in his tracks.

It took two trips to different hospitals to diagnose him with appendicitis, peritonitis and a kidney infection, and he had to be operated on straight away.

Van Dijk, said at the time: ""My body was broken and I couldn't do anything. At such a moment, the worst scenarios are whizzing around your head. For the first time in my life, football was very much a side issue. My life was at risk.

""At some point I had to sign some papers. It was a kind of testament. If I died, a part of my money would go to my mum.""

The operation went well but, despite a quick recovery and some impressive performances, the top clubs in Holland didn't express a big interest.

It was then Celtic signed him for about Â£2.5m in 2013.

""He came in the first day and trained. I had a chat with him and said 'enjoy yourself here because I don't think you'll be here long',"" then manager Neil Lennon recalls.

""He's got pace, composure, physicality, technically brilliant. The progress was impossible to stop. He was such a good player - probably the best I've worked with as a manager.""

After two seasons, including two league titles and a Scottish Cup, Van Dijk moved to Southampton.

""I always thought he had the game and he's proven that,"" said Lennon. ""He could play for any team in the world and I'm surprised Manchester United or Manchester City, Barcelona or Real Madrid didn't come in and buy him rather than Liverpool at the time.""

Van Dijk became the world's most expensive defender when he signed for Liverpool in 2018 for Â£75m.

He has since won the Champions League, Premier League, an FA Cup, two League Cups, the Club World Cup and won the 2019 UEFA player of the year award. He is now just one win away from his second Premier League title.

Van Loon, said: ""He has adapted to new and more challenging situations. He has become captain and the way he deals with the coaching staff and press is very impressive.

""I'm very proud of what he has achieved. And he did it himself, there is no-one who solved things for him.

""He had to pull the strings and take the initiative. It gives such a boost to young people who may also start with nothing and who work to achieve their goals in life.""",https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cd9le3v7n8eo
Women's Six Nations 2025: Emma Sing replaces injured Ellie Kildunne for England's Grand Slam game against France,Gloucester-Hartpury's Emma Sing starts at full-back in place of Ellie Kildunne for England Women's Six Nations Grand Slam decider against France on Saturday.,England,,Alastair Telfer,2025-04-24T14:00:12.309Z,2025-04-24T14:00:12.309Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/b4cb/live/136e2a80-2107-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/b4cb/live/136e2a80-2107-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/articles/c99pj95371go,"Guinness Women's Six Nations: England v France

Gloucester-Hartpury's Emma Sing will start at full-back in the place of injured Ellie Kildunne for England's Women's Six Nations Grand Slam decider against France on Saturday.

World player of the year Kildunne has been ruled out of the game at Allianz Stadium, Twickenham after suffering a minor hamstring injury.

Sing's only previous appearance this Six Nations came in theopening-round win over Italy in York, where the 24-year-old scored 11 points.

""Kildunne could actually play but her hamstring is something we want to get right,"" England head coach John Mitchell said.

""We don't want to lose Ellie as a result of stretching it any further and it means we can back our squad.

""Ellie will be back into it in June [World Cup preparation], there should be no problems there.""

Mitchell's England are on a 24-game winning streak and are chasing a 15th successive win over France to secure a seventh Six Nations title in a row.

Saracens' Zoe Harrison is given the nod at fly-half over Holly Aitchison, who started England's victory overFrance in Bordeaux last yearto clinch the Red Roses' third successive Grand Slam.

Scrum-half Natasha Hunt comes back into the starting XV to partner Harrison, with Lucy Packer named on the bench after impressing from the start in thehammering of Scotlandlast Saturday.

Exeter Chiefs' Maddie Feaunati will make her first England start at open-side flanker, with 2014 World Cup-winner Alex Matthews packing down at number eight.

Captain Zoe Aldcroft - named at blind-side flanker - is the only Red Roses player to start every game this campaign.

""Selection is based on tactical picks and the girls that have been more consistent in the tournament in the skillsets that we require on the weekend,"" Mitchell added.

""That doesn't mean the other girls are any less good but you just have to go with the strengths within your group and use them when you need them.""

Flanker Abi Burton, who scored two tries on herRed Roses debut against Walesin round two, is named on the bench, meaning there is no place for former captain Marlie Packer or Loughborough Lightning's Sadia Kabeya.

Exeter Chiefs' Claudia MacDonald is rewarded for herplayer-of-the-matchperformance in the victory over Scotland with a start on the left wing, meaning regular starter Jessica Breach misses out.

On the bench, hooker Amy Cokayne returns from a pectoral injury that kept her out of the Scotland game in Leicester, while utility back Helena Rowland is named in the 23 jersey.

That call means 35-year-old World Cup-winning centre Emily Scarratt, who came off the bench in last year's win in Bordeaux, misses out on the matchday squad.

Lock Rosie Galligan is named as a replacement but could still miss the game because of a cut on her knee, which was sustained in training and is being managed.

France, who lastdefeated England in 2018, have made two changes in their back row as open-side flanker Lea Champon comes in for a first start this championship and Charlotte Escudero returns at blind-side flanker.

The established half-back duo of Pauline Bourdon Sansus and Carla Arbez again start, while Kelly Arbey returns on the wing, with Joanna Grisez retaining her spot on the opposite side after scoring in thecomeback victory over Italy in Parmalast Saturday.

There is also a potential debut for 20-year-old Taina Maka, who is comfortable in the second row and at flanker.

Saturday's match is the fourth successive time both sides play each in the final game with a Grand Slam on the line.

NFL Draft 2025: Where will Travis Hunter & Shedeur Sanders be drafted?,Travis Hunter threatens to quit while concerns over Shedeur Sanders increase as intrigue builds for this year's NFL Draft.,American Football,,Ben Collins,2025-04-24T08:16:42.087Z,2025-04-24T08:16:42.087Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/c505/live/fca33f80-208d-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/c505/live/fca33f80-208d-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.png,https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/c78jvg19v92o,"NFL Draft 2025

Coverage:Live text commentary via the BBC Sport website and app (from 23:45 BST)

The projected number one pick tends to get the most attention in the build-up to the NFL Draft.

This year, though, it seems Cam Ward has barely had a mention.

The 'unicorn' Travis Hunter and 'nepo baby' Shedeur Sanders have been the main talking points leading into this weekend's event in Green Bay.

The pair have been team-mates for the past three years, becoming two of the biggest stars in US college sport.

Now the uncertainty over their next step has helped make this one of the most intriguing drafts in years.

It is difficult to talk about Sanders without mentioning his father.

Deion Sanders was a Hall of Fame player in the NFL, winning two Super Bowls as a two-way player - he played on both defence and offence.

Nicknamed 'Prime Time', he also played in Major League Baseball and remains one of the most recognisable, charismatic figures in US sport.

He went on to work in the media and became head coach at Jackson State University in 2020, with youngest son Shedeur becoming their quarterback in 2021.

The following year Deion managed to lure two-way player Travis Hunter - 2022's highest-rated college recruit - before the trio left for Colorado in 2023.

Their three seasons together feature in the Amazon series Coach Prime, which helped thrust Colorado into national prominence in the US while the two players became household names.

Shedeur Sanders earned about $6.5m (Â£4.9m)through NIL deals in collegeand Hunter about $5.7m (Â£4.3m).

Sanders was the initial favourite to be the first overall pick in this year's draft. Now he is its most polarising prospect.

The 23-year-old helped Colorado turn around their record last season, posting the best pass completion rate in college football (74%).

He also won one of the annual quarterback awards, but some feel he holds on to the ball too long and have questioned his arm strength and athleticism.

Shedeur, who has been branded a 'nepo baby', says having Deion as his dad has been advantageous to his football career as he has learned to deal with expectation and pressure from a young age.

But in March, some NFL staff said Shedeur came across as ""brash and arrogant"" as well as ""unprofessional and disinterested"" during his interviews at the Scouting Combine - a week-long event where college players are evaluated by NFL teams before the draft.

He is already wealthy and has a bigger profile than any previous draft prospect.

Some teams have been put off by the 'circus' - including his outspoken father - that surrounds Sanders, so some analysts fear he could slide out of the top-five picks, perhaps into the second round.

The NFL has not had a genuine two-way player since Deion Sanders in the 1990s.

In 1997, Charles Woodson won the Heisman Trophy for best college player after playing significant time as both a cornerback and wide receiver but he went on to play solely on defence in the NFL.

Hunter has also been playing as a cornerback and wide receiver, and won not just last year's awards for best defensive player and best receiver - he clinched the Heisman too.

Speaking at the Combine in February, the 21-year-old said his role in the NFL was ""up to the organisation"" that drafts him, with teams having different ideas on what his best position is.

However, last week Hunter said he would ""never play again"" if he is not given the chance to continue being a two-way player in the NFL.

The Cleveland Browns have the second pick and their general manager Andrew Berry has compared Hunter tobaseball's two-way star Shohei Ohtani, adding that ""you get a unicorn if you use him both ways"".

Hunter's father is currently on probation but has beengranted permission to attend the draft,externalwith his son.

Hunter has said it is ""super important"" for him to be the first overall pick but Ward is now the clear favourite to be selected by the Tennessee Titans.

The ex-Miami quarterback has not been described as a generational talent like previous first picks Joe Burrow, Trevor Lawrence and Caleb Williams were in recent years.

However, he has been compared to Patrick Mahomes for his play-making ability â he can throw from different arm angles and make off-platform plays.

Much will then hinge on what Cleveland and the New York Giants do with the second and third picks, respectively.

They both need a young franchise quarterback but this year's draft class is perceived to be weak for quarterbacks and both teams signed veterans in free agency, potentially to bridge them over to next year.

Now the Browns and Giants arereportedly open to trading those early picks,external, or they could go for Hunter and pass rusher Abdul Carter before taking a quarterback with a less valuable pick.

Prospects projected to be early picks tend to be invited to the draft and Sanders is not among the 15 who will be attending.

The New Orleans Saints (ninth pick) and the Pittsburgh Steelers (21st) could also be in the market for a starting quarterback.

If Sanders is still on the board after that then fellow quarterbacks Jaxson Dart, Jalen Milroe and Tyler Shough could all be drafted before him, something no-one thought possible a few months ago.",https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/articles/c78jvg19v92o

Pakistan suspends visas for Indian nationals after Kashmir attack,It comes after Delhi's retaliatory measures following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.,Asia,"Pakistan, Asia, India, Kashmir",Emily McGarvey,2025-04-24T13:40:56.136Z,2025-04-24T13:40:56.136Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3424/live/c3d23c10-210a-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3424/live/c3d23c10-210a-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy76y52l9eo,"Pakistan has responded with tit-for-tat measures against India as tensions soared following a militant attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 tourists.

Islamabad suspended all visas issued to Indian nationals under an exemption scheme with immediate effect, as well as expelling some of its neighbour's diplomats and closing its airspace to Indian flights.

Indian police have named three of four suspected gunmen behind the attack, saying two are Pakistani citizens and a third is a local Kashmiri man. Pakistan denies Indian claims that it played a role in the shooting.

Tuesday's attack saw a group of gunmen fire on tourists near Pahalgam, a resort in the disputed Himalayan region.

Police in Indian-administered Kashmir say all three suspects named are members of the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). None of the men have commented on the allegations.

A statement from Pakistan's National Security Committee rubbished attempts to link the Pahalgam attack to Pakistan, saying there had been no credible investigation or verifiable evidence.

Earlier Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed that ""India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers and we will pursue them to the ends of the Earth.""

He said that the ""terrorists behind the killings, along with their backers, will get a punishment bigger than they can imagine"".

""Our enemies have dared to attack the country's soul...  India's spirit will never be broken by terrorism.""

On Wednesday evening Delhi announced a raft of diplomatic measures against Islamabad in light of the killings in Kashmir - one of them was shutting the Attari-Wagah border between the two countries immediately.

India also cancelled visa services to Pakistani nationals ""with immediate effect"".

In its response, Pakistan also rejected India's suspension of the Indus Water Treaty - a six-decade-old water sharing treaty between the neighbours - adding that any attempt to stop or divert the water ""will be considered as an Act of War"".

The country has closed its airspace to all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines and suspended all trade with India.

It has also reduced the number of diplomats in the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to 30 and asked Indian defence, naval and air advisers to leave Pakistan before 30 April.

About 1,500 people across Kashmir have been detained for questioning in connection with the attack, police sources have told BBC News.

Schools, business and shops are reopening after a shutdown across the region following the shootings.

Police have offered a reward of 2m rupees [$23,000; £17,600] for anyone offering information about any of the attackers.

Visitors from different states in India were killed, with others seriously injured, in one of the deadliest attacks in recent years in the region.

An Indian naval officer on honeymoon, a tourist guide who was the sole breadwinner for his family, and a businessman holidaying with his wife and children were among the victims.

An all-party meeting in Jammu and Kashmir expressed deep shock and anguish at what it called a ""barbaric attack"".

The bodies of victims arriving in their home states around India are being given emotional farewells by their families and loved ones.

Meanwhile, reports are coming in from parts of India of Kashmiri students facing harassment in the aftermath of the killings.

A spokesperson for Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's National Conference party said several videos showing students being harassed in colleges and other places were being circulated online.

Nasir Khuehami, head of the Jammu and Kashmir Students' Association, shared a video of a right-wing Hindu group threatening to physically assault Kashmiri Muslim students in the northern state of Uttarakhand to ensure they leave.

Pahalgam attack: How will India respond to the Kashmir killings,"India will respond but it's not clear how - or at what cost, experts say.

The victims weren't soldiers or officials, but civilians on holiday in one of India's most picturesque valleys. That alone makes this strike both brutal and symbolic: a calculated assault not just on lives, but on a fragile sense of normalcy the Indian state has worked hard to project in the disputed region.

Given the fraught history of Kashmir - claimed in full by both India and Pakistan but ruled by each only in part - India's response is likely to be shaped as much by precedent as by pressure, say experts.

For starters, Delhi has swiftly taken a series ofretaliatory steps: closing the main border crossing, suspending a critical water-sharing treaty, and expelling diplomats.

More significantly, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has vowed a""strong response,""pledging action not just against the perpetrators but also the masterminds behind the ""nefarious acts"" on Indian soil.

The question, analysts say, is not whether there will be a military response - but when, and how calibrated it will be, and at what cost.

""We are likely to see a strong response – one that signals resolve to both domestic audiences and actors in Pakistan. Since 2016 and especially after 2019, the threshold for retaliation has been set at cross-border or air strikes,"" military historian Srinath Raghavan told the BBC.

""It'll be hard for the government to act below that now. Pakistan will likely respond, as it did before. The risk, as always, is miscalculation – on both sides.""

Mr Raghavan is alluding to two previous major retaliations by India in 2016 and 2019.

After thedeadly Uri attackin September 2016, where 19 Indian soldiers were killed, India launched what it called ""surgical strikes"" across the de facto border - also known as the Line of Control (LoC) - targeting what it said were militant launch pads in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

And in 2019, afterat least 40 paramilitary personnel were killed in Pulwama,India hit an alleged militant camp in Balakot with airstrikes- its first such strike deep inside Pakistan since 1971. Pakistan responded with air raids, leading to a dogfight and the brief capture of an Indian pilot. Both sides showed strength but avoided full-scale war.

Two years later, in 2021, theyagreed to an LoC ceasefire, which has largely held - despite recurring militant attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir.

Michael Kugelman, a foreign policy analyst, believes that the combination of high fatality levels and the targeting of Indian civilians in the latest attack ""suggests a strong possibility of an Indian military response against Pakistan, if Delhi determines or merely assumes any level of Pakistani complicity"".

""The chief advantage  of such a reaction for India would be political, as there will be strong public pressure for India to respond forcefully, "" he told the BBC.

""Another advantage, if a retaliation successfully takes out terrorist targets, would be restoring deterrence and degrading an anti-India threat. The disadvantage is that a retaliation would risk a serious crisis and even conflict.""

What are India's options?

Covert action offers deniability but may not satisfy the political need to visibly restore deterrence, says Christopher Clary of the University at Albany in the US.

That leaves India with two possible paths, he notes.

First, the 2021 LoC ceasefire has been fraying, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could greenlight a return to cross-border firing.

Second, airstrikes or even conventional cruise missile strikes, like in 2019, are also on the table - each carrying the risk of a retaliatory spiral, as seen in the air skirmishes that followed then.

""No path is without risks. The US is also distracted and may not be willing or be able to assist with crisis management,"" Mr Clary, who studies the politics of South Asia,  told the BBC.

One of the gravest risks in any India-Pakistan crisis is that both sides are nuclear-armed. That fact casts a long shadow over every decision, shaping not just military strategy but political calculations.

""Nuclear weapons are both a danger and a restraint - they force decision-makers on both sides to act with caution. Any response is likely to be presented as precise and targeted. Pakistan may retaliate in kind, then look for an off-ramp, says Mr Raghavan.

""We've seen this pattern in other conflicts too, like Israel-Iran - calibrated strikes, followed by efforts to de-escalate. But the risk is always that things won't go according to script.""

Mr Kugelman says that one of the lessons of the Pulwama crisis is that ""each country is comfortable using limited counter retaliation"".

""India will need to weigh the political and tactical advantages of retaliation with the risk of a serious crisis or conflict.""

Hussain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador to the US, believes escalation is possible this time, with India likely to consider limited ""surgical strikes"" like in 2016.

""The advantage of such strikes from India's point of view is they are limited in scope, so Pakistan does not have to respond, and yet they demonstrate to the Indian public that India has acted,"" Mr Haqqani, a senior fellow at Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy and Hudson Institute, told the BBC.

""But such strikes can also invite retaliation from Pakistan, which argues that it is being blamed in a knee jerk reaction, without any investigation or evidence.""

Whatever course India chooses - and however Pakistan responds -  each step is fraught with risk. The threat of escalation looms, and with it, the fragile peace in Indian-administered Kashmir slips further out of reach.

At the same time, India must reckon with the security failures that allowed the attack to happen in the first place. ""That such an attack occurred at the peak of tourist season,"" Mr Raghavan noted, ""points to a serious lapse - especially in a Union Territory where the federal government directly controls law and order.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynx7kgyqvo

On Thursday morning, the queue to see the Pope, who is in an open coffin, stretched out of St Peter's Square and down the street - the longest the line had become since his body was moved to lie in state on Wednesday.

Entry to the church in Vatican City had been due to stop at midnight local time (22:00 GMT), but opening hours were extended to accommodate large crowds.

The pontiff died on Monday at the age of 88 after suffering a stroke. He had spent five weeks in hospital earlier this year with double pneumonia.

Pope Francis was the first Latin American leader of the Catholic Church and held the role for 12 years.

Red-robed cardinals and white-clad priests escorted the Pope's coffin from his residence to the basilica on Wednesday.

Bells tolled during the 40-minute procession, while the crowd broke into applause - a traditional Italian sign of respect.

Swiss Guards, who are responsible for the Pope's safety, escorted his coffin to the church's altar.

Public viewing began at 11:00 local time on Wednesday. By mid-afternoon, tens of thousands of people lined the square.

The church was supposed to close at midnight, but police told the BBC that it would stay open all night so that crowds gathered on the square could file past the coffin.

""I think the Pope was an amazing man, so I wanted to see him,"" 13-year-old Edoardo, waiting after midnight with his parents, told the BBC. ""I am really sorry. But I think maybe he will enjoy heaven.""

Viewing continued until 05:30 on Thursday, then closed for an hour and a half, before reopening at 07:00. The crowd became so large that some turned away.

""It looks like five or six hours, so we'll come back later,"" Catherine, from Birmingham, said.

The Pope's body will lie in state in the church until Friday evening, when his coffin will be sealed during a liturgical rite at 20:00, the Vatican said.

The ceremony will be overseen by Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who is the Pope's ""camerlengo"", or chamberlain, and runs the Vatican until a new Pope is chosen.

Luis and Macarena, from Mexico, had come to Rome for their honeymoon and hoped to see the Pope for a special blessing, Luis said seeing the Pope's final resting place would help them to feel a connection.

""Pope Francis is a saint and he will bless us from heaven,"" Luis said.

Mary Ellen, an American who lives in Italy, said she had come to the Vatican on an overnight train to ""say goodbye"".

""I love Papa Francesco,"" she said. ""He's humble, kind, he loves immigrants. I know he's put up with a lot of difficult things in the Vatican. He's fought against power and the power of the Vatican to be a true Christian, true Catholic.""

Inside St Peter's on Wednesday, the atmosphere was quiet and solemn as some people kneeled and  prayed, before slowly moving on.

Many lingered to admire the staggering beauty of the basilica.

Two women who had waited for five hours to see the Pope said it was important to them to say goodbye to the pontiff.

""All these years I followed all he did and it's as if I travelled all over the world with him, even if I was just at home. He liked going everywhere and prioritises the poor,"" one woman said.

Fredrik, who is from Ghana but travelled from Poland, said the Pope had ""done his best"" and ""it is left to us to continue the good works"".

Eva Asensio, a Mexican on holiday in Italy, said she felt an affinity for the Pope.

""We saw him as a good Pope – someone who supported everyone, no matter your sexual orientation, no matter where you came from. He united us,"" she said with tears in her eyes.

Margaux, who is French and lives in Rome, said it was ""powerful to live this"".

To her, Pope Francis meant ""hope"", and his more progressive social views were ""very important"".

""I hope the next Pope will follow his path,"" she said.

Dignitaries from all over the world, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Prince William, will attend the funeral on Saturday.

Pope Francis left clear instructions that he wanted a smaller ceremony in keeping with his simpler tastes as pontiff. He had arranged for a benefactor to pay for it all.

Unlike the vast majority of his predecessors, he will not be buried in St Peter's, but in a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in central Rome, beneath a tombstone inscribed only with his name.

Before being moved to St Peter's, Pope Francis had been lying in an open coffin in the chapel of his home, flanked by Swiss Guards and cardinals in prayer.

His last public appearance was on Easter Sunday, during which he delivered brief remarks to the masses gathered in St Peter's Square from a wheelchair.

He then greeted worshippers and blessed babies as he was driven in a car through the crowds.

His Papal apartments have been sealed, marking the start of the period known as the Sede Vacante - or empty seat - which continues until a new head of the church is elected.

""Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5,000 soldiers a week are dying. Let's get the Peace Deal DONE!"" he said in a post on Truth Social.

The overnight strikes killed at least eight people and injured 77 more, local officials said.

Trump's comments came after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said the US could put more pressure on Russia to secure a ceasefire.

""We believe that if more pressure is applied to Russia, we'll be able to make our positions closer,"" Zelensky told reporters on a visit to South Africa.

When asked if he would be willing to make any concessions, Zelensky said the fact that Ukraine is prepared to negotiate with Russia is a ""huge compromise"" and a ""ceasefire must be the first step.""

Zelensky cut short his South Africa visit after the Kyiv attacks, which he said was ""undoubtedly one of the most difficult and impudent"".

""If Russia says it is ready to cease fire, it must stop massive strikes against Ukraine. It is Ukrainians who are running out of patience, because it is us who are under attack, and no one else,"" he added.

Trump on Wednesday had accused the Ukrainian leader of harming peace negotiations, after Zelensky said Kyiv would not recognise Russian control of Crimea.

Ukraine has long said it will not give up Crimea, a southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.

Trump claimed a deal to end the war was ""very close"", but that Zelensky's refusal to accept US terms ""will do nothing but prolong"" the conflict.

Earlier, US Vice-President JD Vance laid out the US vision for a deal, saying it would ""freeze the territorial lines [...] close to where they are today"".

He said the deal would mean Ukraine and Russia ""are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own"" - without specifying what geographic concessions would have to be made.

When asked by reporters at the White House about whether the administration was looking to recognise Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, Trump said he just wanted to see the war end.

Recognising Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea would not only be politically impossible for Zelensky to accept, it would also be contrary to post-war international legal norms that borders should not be changed by force.

Zelensky said a meeting about ending the conflict between Ukrainian, US, UK and European officials in London on Wednesday was ""difficult but constructive, and it resulted not in differences but a desire to continue working nonetheless"".

The Ukrainian president had travelled on his first visit to South Africa, where he met President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Ramaphosa said during a news briefing alongside Zelensky that he was deeply concerned about the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. He also reiterated South Africa's commitment to speaking to all parties in the conflict.

He added that he had spoken to Putin earlier this week, and the two men ""agreed to work together on a peaceful resolution to the conflict"".

The South African president also said he had spoken to Trump to discuss the peace process in Ukraine and both leaders agreed the war should end as soon as possible.

Ramaphosa in the briefing would not be drawn on whether Ukraine should cede territory to Russia. He also said his call with Trump was not tied to Zelensky's visit, adding that the call had been months in the planning.

Zelensky's visit would have been unimaginable just two years ago, when Ramaphosa led a delegation of African leaders to Kyiv on a self-styled peace mission.

At the time, South Africa's refusal to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a source of frustration for Kyiv.

But the geopolitical landscape has fundamentally changed since that meeting, and both countries now have a lot more in common.

There was some hope before the meeting that South Africa would extend a symbolic gesture to Ukraine, such as inviting it to the G20 summit later this year, which South Africa is hosting. But that invitation never came.

The fact that Zelensky was on South African soil may be seen by some to be a good enough sign of thawing relations, given South Africa and other African countries have refused to take sides in the war.

The US was one of Ukraine's closest allies until the re-election of Trump in November. Now Ukraine is keen to broaden its pool of international partners - particularly in Africa where many countries have strong links with Russia.

South Africa has also suffered from strained relations with Washington, which has expelled its ambassador and removed aid funding.

""The world thinks that Gaza is Hamas and Hamas is Gaza,"" he said. ""We didn't choose Hamas and now Hamas is determined to rule Gaza and tie our fate to its own. Hamas must retreat. ""

Speaking out is dangerous. Hamas has never tolerated dissent. Al-Natour seems undaunted, writing a furious column for the Washington Post at the end of March.

""To support Hamas is to be for Palestinian death,"" he wrote, ""not Palestinian freedom"".

Wasn't it dangerous to speak out in this way, I asked him.

""We need to take a risk and speak out,"" he replied without hesitation.

""I'm 30 years old. When Hamas took over, I was 11. What have I done with my life? My life has been wasted between war and escalating violence for nothing.""

Since Hamas took control of Gaza in 2007 by violently ousting political rivals, a year after winning national elections, there have been three major wars with Israel and two smaller conflicts.

""Humanity demands that we raise our voices,"" al-Natour said, ""despite suppression by Hamas"".

Hamas may be busy fighting Israel, but it's not afraid to punish its critics.

At the end of March, 22-year old Oday al-Rubai was abducted by armed gunmen from a refugee shelter in Gaza City.

Hours later, his body was found covered in horrific wounds.

The Palestinian Independent Commission for Human Rights said Oday had been tortured, calling his death ""a grave violation of the right to life and an extrajudicial killing"".

Al-Rubai had participated in recent anti-Hamas protests. His family blamed Hamas for his death and demanded justice.

Days earlier, a frightened al-Rubai posted a dark, grainy video on social media in which he expressed his fear that Hamas militants were coming for him.

""Gaza has become a city of ghosts,"" he said, glancing over his shoulder.

""I'm stranded in the street, not knowing where to go. I don't know why they're after me. They destroyed us and brought ruin to us.""

At his funeral, a small crowd demanded revenge and repeated demands for Hamas to get out of Gaza.

Last summer,Amin Abed almost suffered the same fate, following his decision to speak out against Hamas.

Masked militants beat him senseless, broke bones all over his body and damaged his kidneys. Abed survived but had to seek medical treatment abroad.

Now living in Dubai, he's still involved in the protest movement, and believes that Hamas' authority is diminished.

""Hamas' power has begun to fade,"" he told me.

""It targets activists and civilians, beats and kills them to scare people. But it's not how it was before.""

Before the ceasefire collapsed last month, Hamas fighters seemed intent on highly visible displays of power.

But now, with Israel once again attacking relentlessly, the same gunmen have retreated underground and Gaza's civilians have been plunged back into the misery of war.

Some of the more recent protests suggest that civilians, driven to the edge of madness by a year and a half of Israeli bombardment, are losing their fear of Hamas.

Beit Lahiya, at the northern end of the Gaza Strip, has seen some of the most vociferous opposition.

In a series of voice notes, an eyewitness – who asked not to be named – described several recent incidents in which local residents prevented Hamas fighters from carrying out military actions from inside their community.

On 13 April, he said, Hamas gunmen tried to force their way into the house of an elderly man, Jamal al-Maznan.

""They wanted to launch rockets and pipes [a derogatory term used for some of Hamas' home-made projectiles] from inside his house,"" the eyewitness told us.

""But he refused.""

The incident soon escalated, with relatives and neighbours all coming to al-Maznan's defence. The gunmen opened fire, injuring several people, but eventually were driven out.

""They were not intimidated by the bullets,"" the eyewitness said of the protesters.

""They advanced and told [the gunmen] to take their things and flee. We don't want you in this place. We don't want your weapons that have brought us destruction, devastation and death.""

Elsewhere in Gaza, protesters have told militants to stay away from hospitals and schools, to avoid situations in which civilians are caught up in Israeli air strikes.

But such defiance is still risky. In Gaza City, Hamas shot one such protester dead.

With little to lose and hopes of an end to the war dashed once more, some Gazans direct their fury equally at Israel and Hamas.

Asked which side he blamed most for Gaza's catastrophe, Amin Abed said it was ""a choice between cholera and the plague"".

The protest movement of recent weeks is not yet a rebellion, but after almost 20 years of rule Hamas' iron grip on Gaza is slowly slipping.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c175z14r8pro
DR Congo government and M23 rebels agree ceasefire after Qatar talks,"Both parties reaffirm their commitment to an ""immediate
cessation of hostilities"" in latest truce deal. 
",Africa,"Democratic Republic of Congo, Africa",Wycliffe Muia ,2025-04-24T07:00:58.853Z,2025-04-24T08:20:46.767Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/03c1/live/d296eed0-20e2-11f0-9b17-b99e39a28c13.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/03c1/live/d296eed0-20e2-11f0-9b17-b99e39a28c13.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3evwqxpv34o,"The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have agreed to halt fighting in the east of the country until peace talks mediated by Qatar reach their ""conclusion"".

It is the latest truce since the rebels stepped up an offensive in eastern DR Congo where authorities say 7,000 people have been killed since January.

Both sides on Wednesday jointly announced to work towards peace following more than a week of talks, which they described as ""frank and constructive"".

Last month, Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame alsoreaffirmed their commitment to an ""unconditional"" ceasefire in a surprise meeting in Doha.

The decades-long conflict has intensified since January when M23 staged an unprecedented offensive, seizing Goma and Bukavu - eastern Congo's two largest cities - and sparking fears of a wider regional war.

DR Congo accuses Rwanda of arming the M23 and sending troops to support the rebels in the conflict. Despite assertions from both the UN and US, Rwanda has denied supporting the M23.

Rwanda has said its forces are acting in self-defence against the Congolese army and allied militias, some of which it accuses of links to the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

DR Congo also accuses Rwanda of illegally exploiting its mineral deposits in the east of the country, which Rwanda denies.

In a joint statement released separately by the M23 and Congolese government on Wednesday, each side pledged to give peace talks a chance.

""By mutual agreement, both parties reaffirm commitment to the immediate cessation of hostilities, a categorical rejection of any hate speech, intimidation, and call on all local communities to uphold these commitments,"" they said in a statement read on Congolese national TV and andposted on X by the M23 spokespersonLawrence Kanyuka.

They said the ceasefire would apply ""throughout the duration of the talks and until their conclusion"".

Sources in the Qatar talks told Reuters news agency that the outcome of the meetings were almost derailed by ""technical"" issues.

It is not clear how long the truce will hold as several ceasefires have been agreed since 2021, before later collapsing.

Belgium's Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Prevottermed the truce a ""crucial step towards ending the violence"".

Qatar has been mediating between the two parties after the rebels refused to attend peace talks in Angola last month.

The Congolese government had long refused to hold direct talks with M23, branding it a ""terrorist"" group.

Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky meets South Africa's Cyril Ramaphosa to counter Russia,Volodymyr Zelensky ends an historic visit to South Africa to counter Russia's influence on the continent.,World,"War in Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, Russia, Cyril Ramaphosa, Donald Trump, South Africa, Vladimir Putin, Africa, Ukraine",Farouk Chothia,2025-04-23T23:25:13.221Z,2025-04-24T12:44:40.497Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/696a/live/ef484030-2108-11f0-b1ba-8bc47850ff39.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/696a/live/ef484030-2108-11f0-b1ba-8bc47850ff39.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g75825r94o,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has ended an historic visit to South Africa, signalling a dramatic improvement in the once-strained relations between the two nations.

The visit marked a diplomatic breakthrough for the Ukrainian leader in his efforts to counter Russia's strong - and growing - influence in Africa.

""I'm sure that Russia will be annoyed by the visit, but I don't think it can do much about it,"" said Steven Gruzd of the South African Institute of International Relations think-tank.

But Russia disrupted Zelensky's visit by carrying out an air strike on Ukraine's capital Kyiv, forcing him to announce that he will cut short the trip by returning home immediately after meeting President Cyril Ramaphosa.

The South African leader said the visit had ""reaffirmed"" the bonds between the two nations, pointing out that Zelensky's visit was the first in 33 years by a Ukrainian head of state.

Apart from a brief stopover in Cape Verde in 2023 while flying to Argentina, this was also Zelensky's first visit to Africa since he became Ukraine's president in 2019.

Ukraine grasped the diplomatic significance of African states, when many of them - including regional powerhouse South Africa - refused to condemn Russia's full-scale invasion of its territory in 2022.

""Ukraine neglected the continent in terms of foreign policy, but it has changed that over the last three years, doubling its embassies from 10 to 20,"" Mr Gruzd told the BBC.

""But it's in a very crowded space - Russia, China, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates are all trying to increase their influence in Africa.""

Zelensky's visit to South Africa at this point was especially significant, as Ukraine's relationship with the US - its main weapons supplier - has soured since President Donald Trump took office in January.

He briefly paused military aid, denounced Zelenksy as a ""dictator"", and has accused Ukraine of being responsible for the war.

""Ukraine needs every bit of legitimacy it can get internationally - not just in Europe.   Wars aren't only won in the battlefield, but also in courts of public opinion around the world,"" said Prof Siphamandla Zondi, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg.

For South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa, the visit was equally significant, as his country, too, was under intense pressure from the Trump administration.

""The US has turned diplomacy on its head,"" Mr Gudz said, adding: ""Everyone is looking for new friends.""

Ramaphosa saw Zelensky's visit as an attempt to boost his credentials as a peacemaker, saying their talks focused on efforts to reach a ""comprehensive peace"".

The South African leader also held a phone conversation with Putin ahead of Zelensky's visit.

""We both affirmed the strong bilateral relations between our respective countries,""Ramaphosa said in a post on X.

""We further committed to working together towards a peaceful resolution of the Russia-Ukraine conflict,"" he added.

Ramaphosa first tried to assume the role of peacemaker in 2023 when he led a delegation of African leaders to both Kyiv and Moscow in an attempt to mediate an end to the conflict.

The initiative came as South Africa faced a backlash from then-US President Joe Biden's administration, which questioned its professed neutrality in the conflict after it held a naval exercise with Russia and China.

Relations worsened after Washington's then-ambassador to Pretoriaaccused South Africa of supplying arms and ammunition to Russia.

Ramaphosa later appointed a judge-led inquiry to investigate the allegation. It found no evidence to back up the ambassador's claim, but relations between South Africa and the Biden administration remained strained.

South Africa's ties with Russia have not been a sore point for Trump, as he too gets along with Putin and has been pushing Zelensky to make a deal with the Russian leader.

However, Trump's relationship with South Africa has reached rock bottom over its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and for what he calls the ""unjust and immoral practices"" against the white-minority Afrikaner community - an allegation Ramaphosa's government denies.

Prof Zondi said South Africa would have to ensure that Ramaphosa's talks with Zelensky did not hurt its attempts to mend relations with the Trump administration.

""South Africa will want to explain that it is adding to the efforts to build peace, and its role is not in competition with that of [the] US,"" he added.

Ramaphosa was on cue, announcing on Thursday that he had spoken to Trump about the conflict in Ukraine.

Crucially, Ramaphosa also seized the opportunity to discuss relations between South Africa and the US, and said he and Trump had agreed to meet soon.

This would be their first meeting since Trump's return to office, and Ramaphosa will be hoping that US-South Africa relations get back on track.

Earlier this month, Trump announced a 30% tariff on South African goods, although he later paused the hike for 90 days.

Ramaphosa will be hoping that their talks lead to Trump softening his stance, as such high tariffs would be a major blow to South Africa's economy.

Ramaphosa's talks with Zelensky also focused on strengthening trade ties with Ukraine, as South Africa's economy was in crisis, with low growth and high unemployment.

""Any volume of trade, no matter how small, is critical for South Africa,"" Prof Zondi said, adding that strong relations between the two nations could also benefit Ukraine in its efforts to extend its influence on the continent.

""South Africa could be Ukraine's gateway to Africa because of its ports and financial systems,"" Prof Zondi said.

If this happens, it would mark a new chapter in Ukraine-Africa relations, though not necessarily at the expense of Russia.

""Both Russia and Ukraine are the biggest exporters of cereals to Africa. Africa needs both. It cannot be expected to choose sides,"" the analyst said.

Santa Maria Maggiore: The church to become Pope Francis's resting place,The Pope would visit Santa Maria Maggiore whenever he returned to Rome and chose it as the site of his grave.,Europe,"Pope Francis, Roman Catholic Church, Rome, Italy",Laura Gozzi,2025-04-23T21:41:16.121Z,2025-04-23T21:41:16.121Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7368/live/53ba56c0-2087-11f0-b7c0-4f6e24ac1319.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7368/live/53ba56c0-2087-11f0-b7c0-4f6e24ac1319.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrgzl0vyqpo,"Every time Pope Francis came back to Rome after a trip abroad, he made sure to pay a visit to the church of Santa Maria Maggiore.

It was a fitting choice: Francis was particularly devoted to the Virgin Mary, and Santa Maria Maggiore was the first church to be dedicated to her when it was built in the 4th Century.

It is one of Rome's four major basilicas and one of the oldest in the city.

On Saturday, it will also become Francis's final resting place.

It is a short walk from some of Rome's most recognisable landmarks like the Colosseum, and a stone's throw from the city's endlessly bustling and chaotic central Termini station. The diverse Esquilino neighbourhood is close by.

Santa Maria Maggiore feels steeped in the ""real"" Rome – despite technically being a part of the Vatican state.

The square it stands on - lined with bus stops, cafes and shops - certainly seems a world away from the awe-inspiring St Peter's Square and its imposing basilica, under which Popes are usually buried in centuries-old crypts.

And yet the chapels, mosaics and gilded wood of Santa Maria Maggiore remain stunning. Seven other popes are buried here.

The basilica also hosts what is said to be a relic of Jesus's crib and an icon of Mary, to whom Pope Francis would pray asking for protection before a journey.

Santa Maria Maggiore's senior priest, the Lithuanian Rolandas Makrickas, gave Italian newspaper Il Messaggero his account of how the Pope's decision to be laid to rest there came about.

He said: ""In May 2022… I asked him if he wasn't by any chance thinking about being buried in [the basilica], given how often he came.""

Francis smiled and said that Popes are buried in St Peter's - ""and that was that"", Makrickas thought.

The priest continued: ""A week later he called me and said, 'the Virgin Mary has told me to prepare my tomb'.

""Then he simply told me, 'find a place for it, because I want to be buried in this basilica and you've been a bit of a prophet'.""

The place Mackrickas found is next to the icon of Mary that the Pope so loved. It is now cordoned off and obscured by plywood.

A security guard who wished to remain anonymous told BBC News stories of Pope Francis visiting the church on many occasions.

""Yes, we used to see him all the time when he came here,"" he said, interrupting himself to sternly invite tourists to put their phones away or cover their shoulders.

""After a few times of seeing him, one time he looked at me and asked me, 'why are you always here?'

""And I said, 'Holy Father, I'm working just as you are'.""

As the security guard spoke, people continued to stream in from the blazing sunshine into the quiet shade of the basilica.

Several queued outside wooden booths, each topped with a sign indicating in which languages the priests inside could hear confessions.

Every few minutes, the chatter would be momentarily quietened by a voice hissing over the loudspeaker: ""Silenzio.""

Outside, a woman called Pat from Manchester was squinting at the sun and gathering her thoughts.

""I came here because this is where the Pope used to come before any journey,"" she told the BBC, raising her voice over the sound of the midday bells tolling.

""That's why I've always wanted to come and it hasn't disappointed.""

After a pause, she said: ""Beautiful isn't the word. It's just vast, it's enormous.""

Apologising for not being able to put her emotions into words, she said she was ""particularly impressed"" that many of the six chapels hold different masses at different times, ""so if you're late for one, you can go into another"".

Pat heard the news about the Pope's death when her plane from the UK landed in Rome on Monday morning.

It did not scupper her visit. As a devout Catholic, she said Santa Maria Maggiore ""was always the place I wanted to come"" because Francis loved it so.

""I came without any sort of preconceived idea and I made a point of not reading up about it, I just wanted to take the atmosphere in, and feel it.""

""And I did,"" she said, looking up at the basilica. ""I am full of the spirit.""

On Saturday afternoon, after the world has had a chance to bid farewell to him, Pope Francis will make his final journey from the Vatican to Santa Maria Maggiore, as he did so often in life.

The church will be shut for a few hours, then the stream of visitors will resume.

Some, like Pat, will continue to come to the basilica and try to put something intangible into words. Others will simply admire the mosaics.

And on the left hand side, by an icon of the Virgin Mary, Santa Maria Maggiore's newest resident will begin his rest.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrgzl0vyqpo

The authorities had previously said that only eight soldiers were killed.

The revised figure makes it the deadliest known attack since insurgents began operating in northern Benin at the beginning of the decade.

The attack has been claimed by an al-Qaeda-linked group - Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen, (Jnim), which is based in Mali but has in recent years expanded its operations to neighbouring countries.

The jihadist group had said it killed 70 soldiers in raids on two military posts in the north, according to intelligence group SITE.

Jnim is one of several jihadist groups operating in West Africa's Sahel region, especially Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where the military governments are struggling to contain the insurgency.

Benin and Togo have seen a rise in jihadist activity in recent years, as groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaeda spread to the south.

""Heavy losses for the nation,"" wrote presidential spokesman Serge Nonvignon in a Facebook post on Wednesday.

Another government spokesperson, Wilfried Leandre Houngbedji, said that Benin was determined to continue the fight against the jihadists.

""We won't give in... I can assure you that sooner or later, sooner or later, we will win,"" he said.

Tanzania bans South Africa and Malawi imports as trade row escalates,Tanzanian bananas are among the things hit in the dispute after Malawi stopped them from entering.,Africa,"Tanzania, Malawi, South Africa, Africa",Sammi Awami ,2025-04-24T08:30:38.134Z,2025-04-24T11:21:06.324Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15fe/live/2a71e6c0-20e6-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/15fe/live/2a71e6c0-20e6-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg7jkx04d0o,"A normally bustling border crossing between Tanzania and Malawi was noticeably quieter than usual on Thursday as a result of an escalating regional trade row.

From midnight, Tanzania banned the entry of all agricultural imports from Malawi and South Africa in response to what it sees as restrictions on some of its exports.

South Africa has for years prohibited the entry of bananas from Tanzania. Malawi last month blocked imports of flour, rice, ginger, bananas and maize from its northern neighbour.

""We are taking this step to protect our business interests... in business, we must all respect each other,"" Tanzania's Agriculture Minister Hussein Bashe said on Wednesday, confirming the ban.

Diplomatic efforts to resolve the trade issues have so far failed but Bashe said fresh talks were ongoing.

The row comes at a time when Africa is supposed to be moving towards greater free trade through the establishment of acontinent-wide free-trade area, which began operating four years ago.

South African exports of various fruits, including apples and grapes, to Tanzania will be hit. Meanwhile, landlocked Malawi, which has relied on Tanzanian ports to carry its exports such as tobacco, sugar and soybeans to the rest of the world, will have to reroute its goods.

Malawi's ban on the import of certain produce, announced in March, was designed as a temporary measure covering goods from all countries to protect local producers, according to the authorities in Lilongwe.

""It is a strategic move to create an environment where local businesses can thrive without the immediate pressure of foreign competition,"" Malawi's Trade Minister Vitumbiko Mumba said at the time.

Tanzania's agriculture minister said Malawi's move had ""directly affected"" his country's traders and described the restrictions as ""unfair and harmful"".

While confirming the import ban, Bashe assured Tanzanians that it would not threaten their food security.

""No Tanzanian will die from a lack of South African grapes or apples,"" he said, adding that, ""we are taking these actions to protect Tanzanian interests"".

Neither South Africa nor Malawi have commented on Tanzania's move.

At the Kasumulu crossing, through which most Tanzania-Malawi trade passes, only a handful of lorries transporting cargo such as fuel were spotted on the Tanzanian side.

On a normal day, more than 15 lorries loaded with agricultural produce would cross the frontier, drivers told BBC.

On the Malawian side, many lorries that should be transporting bananas and tomatoes through Tanzania were parked and empty.

""[The drivers] are now trying to find alternative products to transport. It's been very difficult for them because they are used to carrying agricultural goods, and now they can't carry not just bananas and tomatoes, but even maize and potatoes,"" Happy Zulu, a business person, told BBC.

Trade flows between Tanzania, Malawi and South Africa - all members of the Southern African Development Community (Sadc), a regional political, security and economic body - were already being affected last week.

On Saturday Basheposted a social media video showing a pile of rotten bananasin a truck stranded at the border with Malawi, saying it was hard for Tanzania  to tolerate the trend.

Tonnes of tomatoes also spoiled at the border recently after lorries from Tanzania were denied entry into Malawi.

Malawi has become an increasingly important market for Tanzanian goods in recent years, with exports trebling between 2018 and 2023, according to official Tanzanian figures.

But while Tanzania can seek alternative markets such as in Kenya, Namibia and South Sudan, landlocked Malawi may find it harder to get its goods out of the country.

Much of its exports go through the Tanzanian port of Dar es Salaam, as well as essential imports such as fuel and machinery.

Losing access to Dar es Salaam would likely force Malawi to move shipments through the Mozambican ports of Beira and Nacala - options that may be more expensive.

Bashe argued the ban was not meant to provoke a trade war but to protect Tanzania's interests.

""Tanzania will not continue to allow unequal market access to persist at the expense of its people,"" he said.

The star, 23, is now among only a handful of K-pop artists who have come out publicly.

Bain made the announcement in front of fans while performing a solo at a concert in Los Angeles on Tuesday night.

The moment was met with loud cheers from the crowd, according to videos circulating on social media.

""To anyone out there who's part of the LGBT community, or still figuring it out - this is for you guys,"" Bain, whose real name is Song Byeong-hee, said in avideoposted on his social media after the concert.

""You are seen, you are loved, and you were born this way,"" he added, before launching into a performance of Born This Way by pop icon Lady Gaga, whom he referred to as ""my queen"".

His bandmates welcomed the announcement. Just B member Siwoo said he cried while watching Bain's performance. ""I know how hard it was for him, and that made me want to cry more,"" he said, according to Korean media outlet News1.

The band's fans have shown their support as well. ""We love you so much and are so proud of you for being yourself,"" reads a top-liked comment under his Instagram post.

""You are so loved. So proud to be your fan. Be proud of who you are,"" another fan wrote.

Formed in 2021, Just B is a six-member act that has released five EPs and multiple singles.

Coming out remains extremely rare in South Korea's highly-pressurised entertainment industry. While homosexuality is not illegal in the country, it remains taboo, and same-sex marriage is not legally recognised.

A 2022 Human Rights Watch report described discrimination against LGBT people in South Korea as ""pervasive"".

Bain is not the first K-pop star to come out. Just last month, Lara, an Indian-American member of the girl group Katseye, came out as queer on a K-pop fan community platform. In 2020, Jiae from the now-disbanded girl group Wassup announced on Instagram that she is bisexual.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6jzd6g9nwo

Several other people were also wounded when missiles hit the market area of Jabalia town. Video footage showed crowds gathered around the remains of a flattened building.

The Israeli military said it struck a ""command-and-control centre"" for Hamas and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Jabalia that was being used to plan attacks.

At least 17 other people were reportedly killed elsewhere in Gaza on Thursday.

They included a family of six - a couple and their four children - whose home in the northern Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood of Gaza City was bombed, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency.

A relative, Nidal al-Sarafiti, said the family had been asleep at the time of the strike.

The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) identified the man who was killed as Ali al-Sarafiti, who it said was a member of the armed group and a former prisoner who was jailed for 13 years in Israel after being convicted over an attempted suicide attack.

There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.

Palestinian media also said three displaced people were killed when their family tent was hit near Nuseirat, in central Gaza, and that two children died in a strike on another tent in the southern Khan Younis area.

Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 1,978 people have been killed since Israel resumed its offensive against Hamas on 18 March following the collapse of a two-month ceasefire.

Israel says it is putting military pressure on Hamas to release the 59 hostages it is still holding, 24 of whom are believed to be alive.

It has also blocked all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza for seven weeks, which the UN says is ""further depriving people of the means for survival and undermining every aspect of civilian life"".

The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.

More than 51,300 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g28g02ng2o
Jordan bans Muslim Brotherhood after arrests over attack plots,"It is not clear how the ban will affect the Brotherhood's political arm, which is the largest opposition group in parliament.",World,Jordan,David Gritten,2025-04-24T01:31:40.320Z,2025-04-24T01:31:40.320Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/adbf/live/e4990d90-209f-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/adbf/live/e4990d90-209f-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4w8prpkepo,"Jordan's government has banned the Muslim Brotherhood a week after it said members of the Islamist group had been arrested on suspicion of planning rocket and drone attacks.

Interior Minister Mazen al-Faraya told a news conference that all of the Brotherhood's offices would be closed and its assets confiscated, and that any activities would be considered illegal.

There was no immediate response from the Brotherhood, which denied any links to the alleged attack plots.

It is not clear how the ban will affect the group's political arm, the Islamic Action Front, which is the largest opposition group in parliament. But its headquarters was raided by police following Faraya's announcement.

The IAF's secretary general, Wael Saqqa, insisted that it was an independent political party, explaining that it had ""no relationship with any other organisational body"".

""We always declare that we are committed to order, the law, and the provisions of the constitution,"" he said.

In 2020, Jordan's top court ruled that the Brotherhood was ""dissolved"" because it had not settled its legal status.

However, the group continued its political and other activities, and the IAF participated in last year's parliamentary elections, winning 31 out of the 138 seats.

Last week, Jordan's General Intelligence Department said it had arrested 16 people suspected of planning attacks aimed at ""targeting national security, sowing chaos and sabotage"".

They involved possession of explosives and automatic weapons, the manufacture of rockets, the concealment of one rocket ready to be launched, a project to manufacture drones, and the training of individuals both in Jordan and abroad, it said.

Faraya claimed during Wednesday's news conference that members of the Brotherhood ""operate in the shadows and engage in activities that could undermine stability and security"".

Authorities had found ""explosives and weapons transported between Jordanian cities and stored in residential areas"", as well as covert rocket manufacturing facilities and training and recruitment operations, he alleged.

He also said Brotherhood members had attempted to remove and destroy  documents from their headquarters ""in an effort to conceal their activities and suspicious affiliations"".

The group has denied having any involvement in, or knowledge of, the alleged attack plot and stressed that it is ""committed to its peaceful approach"".

The Brotherhood was founded in Egypt almost 100 years ago and has local branches across the world. One of its aims is to create a state ruled by Islamic law, or Sharia.

It is outlawed in Egypt and several Arab countries, whose governments see it as a threat.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4w8prpkepo
US intensifying bid to end Ukraine war - but chances of success remain unclear,Negotiations are gathering pace but the proposals being put forward by Trump's team still have major gaps.,Europe,"War in Ukraine, Russia, Ukraine",James Landale,2025-04-23T14:19:22.040Z,2025-04-23T14:19:22.040Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/554a/live/54bf0510-2051-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/554a/live/54bf0510-2051-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70znjwezd4o,"The pace of diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine is quickening.

Talks are taking place in London between officials from the UK, Germany, France, Ukraine and the United States. Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is heading to Moscow for his fourth meeting with President Putin.

And yet there is little clarity about where these efforts are heading or whether they will be successful.

Not so long ago the American plan for ending the fighting in Ukraine was clear.

There would be an immediate, unconditional 30-day ceasefire followed by longer-term talks to establish a permanent settlement to the war.

Ukraine agreed to this and – under pressure from the US – made a huge concession; it would no longer demand the promise of long-term security guarantees before any cessation of hostilities.

But Russia refused to play ball, insisting there could be no end to the fighting until a whole series of conditions were met.

In particular, Vladimir Putin said ""the root causes"" of the war had to be addressed, namely his fears of an expanding Nato alliance and the very existence of Ukraine as a sovereign state somehow presenting a threat to Russia's security.

The US accepted the premise of this Russian argument and is now deep in the weeds of a potential ceasefire proposal.

In recent days, there have been various leaks about the latest US ideas, the status and veracity of which is disputed among diplomats.

But there seems to be a framework along the following lines: Russia would halt its invasion along current lines, and would give up its ambition to control the remaining parts of the four regions of eastern Ukraine it has yet to occupy, namely Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.

In return, the US would accept the four occupied territories de facto as Russian controlled.

It would also recognise Crimea – which was annexed illegally by Russia in 2014 – as de jure Russian territory. The US would also ensure Ukraine ruled out joining Nato.

As part of this plan, the US might also take control of the controversial Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant – currently in Russian hands – and feed the electricity to both parts of Ukrainian territory.

This proposal would then be backed up with the US threat – as rehearsed by both President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio – that it would give up on the negotiations if there was no immediate agreement.

At first sight, this proposal seems unlikely to succeed.

President Zelensky has already made it clear Ukraine would never concede that Crimea is Russian sovereignty.

Even if he wanted to do that, he could not because it would first require a referendum of the Ukrainian people.

The European powers have made clear they would not accept Russian sovereignty over Crimea, something that would breach post-war international legal norms that borders should not be changed by military force.

Legal experts say there are even technical issues about the US recognising Crimea because of certain laws passed by the US Congress.

But despite that, western diplomats do not dismiss the plan out of hand. ""There is a landing space,"" one told me. ""It is just a question of whether there is enough trust between the parties to move forward.""

They say that because the proposed deal, as leaked so far, contains huge gaps.

There is no reference to any ban on western countries continuing to rearm Ukraine, something that in the past has been a red line for Russia.

There is no reference, either, to Russia's demands for Ukraine to be ""demilitarised"", in other words for its army to be reduced massively in size, again another long-term Moscow demand.

Under the deal, Ukraine may not be allowed to join Nato but it could join the European Union.

There is no apparent objection to a European ""reassurance force"" deploying to western Ukraine after any ceasefire to deter future Russian aggression.

But it is still not clear if the US is willing to provide a ""backstop"" to this force. There is also uncertainty about what economic sanctions against Russia would be lifted and when, and under what circumstances.

In other words, a huge amount of detail is unclear and still to be discussed.

And all sides seem far apart.

Ukraine still wants an immediate conditional ceasefire and then talks. The US wants a quick win. And Russia wants to get deep into the detail of a peace deal, the like of which normally takes months if not years to resolve.

There is an old Russian saying that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"". Right now we seem far away from that.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70znjwezd4o

At least 151 were injured jumping from high places, the governor of Turkey's largest city said on X. There were no deaths and no major structural damage reported, authorities said.

The largest earthquake on Wednesday struck at 12:49 local time (09:49 GMT) at a depth of 6.92 km (4.3 miles), Turkey's emergency services said.

Large groups of people remained on the streets as aftershocks struck in the afternoon, and many have prepared to spend the night outside to safeguard against another strong tremor.

The epicentre of the 6.2-magnitude tremor was located along the coast of the Sea of Marmara, in the Silivri area about 80 km (50 miles) west of Istanbul. City authorities said more than 50 aftershocks had been recorded in the hours since.

Residents reported the main earthquake as one of the strongest they had felt in years, with many saying they feared an even bigger quake.

Many gathered to spend the evening outdoors in the main square in Besiktas, a large student area and one of the city's busiest.

Selim Ustaoglu, a student, told the BBC he grabbed a few essentials as he fled his accommodation, and would not be returning for at least the night.

He packed a small bag with a charger, toothbrush and his favourite sweater before heading to the square. ""I'm staying here tonight,"" he said.

Zeynep Akincioglu, another student, said he didn't feel he could take his family home under the threat of more shocks. ""I don't feel safe going back inside, our building doesn't look strong,"" he said.

Selva Demiralp, an economics professor at Koc University, told the BBC she was with her family in a high-rise when the earthquake struck and it was ""quite scary"".

""We are safe, it looks there was no damage in buildings,"" she said. But she added that people were nervous about whether the quake ""was a foreshock itself"" and the ""real one is on its way"".

There has been little visible structural damage to the city, however. Authorities said an abandoned building in the Fatih district on the European side of the city had collapsed.

Energy and gas supplies, drinking water and sewerage infrastructure were unaffected, it added in a post on X.

Schools were closed on Wednesday due to a public holiday. They will remain so on Thursday and Friday, Education Minister Yusuf Tekin said, though open ground would be available for use as safe spaces.

Southern Turkey was devastated by two giant earthquakes in 2023, which killed more than 55,000 people.

Istanbul is Turkey's most populous city and home to 16 million people - a fifth of the country's residents. The city lies 20km to the north of the North Anatolian Fault Line.

Harvey Weinstein rape retrial: Opening statements begin in New York,"Weinstein, who has pleaded not guilty to sex crimes, returns to court after a conviction was overturned.

""The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,"" Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors on Wednesday.

In his third trial in five years, Weinstein is accused of sexually abusing a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress and a model.

The former film mogul has pleaded not guilty, and in court his lawyer sought to cast doubt on the women's claims and credibility.

Attorney Arthur Aidala told the jury the prosecution case would ""fall flat on its face"" after they heard all the evidence.

""They're going to ask you to make sense of things that just don't make sense,"" he said.

A court of appeals overturned Weinstein's previous conviction for sex crimes in New York last April, before he was indicted on new sexual assault charges in the state in September.

Last week, 12 jurors - seven women and five men - were chosen to weigh Weinstein's fate.

On Wednesday, Ms Lucey spent an hour delivering an opening statement, telling jurors that three women had fallen victim to the abuse of a ""Hollywood gatekeeper"" who held ""unfettered power for over 30 years in that industry"".

The retrial in New York is centred on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, actress Jessica Mann and former TV production assistant Miriam Haley. This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16.

On Wednesday, Ms Lucey recounted the three women's stories of assault and harassment, sparing few details. The alleged encounters often involved Weinstein bringing women to his room under the guise of a business meeting, before he allegedly forced himself onto them.

Victims ""kept their shame and their pain to themselves"" for years because of Weistein's role as a man who ""defined the field"" of acting and film, Ms Lucey said.

During his hour of opening statements that followed, Weinstein's attorney took a combative approach, accusing the women of having ""mutually beneficial"" sexual relationships with Weinstein and being motivated by money.

""These women are addicted to that fame,"" Mr Aidala said. ""They want to be heroes.""

Mr Aidala argued that Weinstein could not have assaulted the women because they kept in contact with him and sent him friendly messages after the encounters.

Last April, a court of appeals said Weinstein, now 73, did not receive a fair trial in New York in 2020 because the judge overseeing his case allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him for conduct he was never charged over.

Weinstein had been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison after being convicted.

He was also found guilty of rape in a separate trial in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in that case.

Weinstein has several medical conditions, including cancer and diabetes. In September, he was taken to hospital for heart surgery and has been held in a secure hospital unit.

A judge has approved a request from Weinstein's lawyers to let him stay at the Bellevue hospital in Manhattan when he is not in court.

His lawyers had complained that he was receiving poor medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at the infamous Rikers Island prison facility - which officials have long said they plan to close - though the move has been delayed.

In total, Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by more than 100 women.

He is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison, as he has yet to begin serving his 16-year California sentence.

The decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.

Speaking to jurors on Wednesday, Ms Lucey said the movement had allowed the three women to come forward in the criminal case against Weinstein after they ""suddenly realized they were not alone"".

Before the allegations against him emerged, Weinstein and his brother Bob were among Hollywood's ultimate power players.

Weinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.

His films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 wins.

The former film mogul has also faced a number of civil lawsuits, including from a group of women who accused him of sexual harassment and rape and reached a $19m (£14.2) settlement with him in 2020.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn4y4pzq7o
Elon Musk to step back from Doge as Tesla profits plunge,The tech boss says he intends to spend only one to two days a week on Trump administration matters.,Technology,"Elon Musk, International Business, Tesla, Donald Trump",Lily Jamali,2025-04-22T21:28:40.597Z,2025-04-23T09:16:40.196Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/54dd/live/0534ad00-200c-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/54dd/live/0534ad00-200c-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0x50yr46lo,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to ""significantly"" cut back his role in the US government after the electric car firm reported a huge drop in profit and sales for the start of this year.

Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.

But Musk said his ""time allocation to Doge"" would ""drop significantly"" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla.

His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world.

Temporary government employees, such as Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, is set to expire late next month.

But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely.

Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk ""as long as I could keep him"".

The tech boss said he would now ""be allocating far more of my time to Tesla"", but suggested he would not leave the Trump administration completely, calling the work ""critical"" and pledging to stay on ""as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful"".

On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%.

The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying ""changing political sentiment"" could meaningfully hurt demand.

Musk blamed the boycott of Tesla cars on people who would ""try to attack me and the Doge team"".

Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results.

Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. ""Rapidly evolving trade policy"" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company.

""This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,"" Tesla's quarterly update said.

Musk hasclashedon trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.

On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were ""still tough on a company where margins are low"".

""I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,"" he said.

Earlier this month, he called Navarro a ""moron"" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was ""not a car manufacturer"" but a ""car assembler, in many cases"".

Georg Ell, who knew Musk and was director for Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme that if the multi-billionaire ""focuses on the companies where he is extraordinary, I think people will focus once again on the quality of the product and experiences"".

""I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he's a pretty single-minded individual,"" added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase.

Tesla said artificial intelligence would contribute to future growth, though investors have been unconvinced by such arguments in the past.

Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations ""rock-bottom"" after the companysaidearlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years.

The firm faces fierce competition, Mr Coatsworth said, warning that potential disruption to global supply chains as a result of Trump's trade war also created risks.

""Tesla's problems are mounting,"" he said.

"Massad Boulos: Africa is important to Trump, US envoy tells BBC","Donald Trump ""highly values Africa and African people"", says his African envoy, Massad Boulos.",Africa,"Donald Trump, Africa",Wycliffe Muia and Rob Young ,2025-04-23T15:04:55.065Z,2025-04-23T15:31:09.146Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6c40/live/acbe16e0-2040-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6c40/live/acbe16e0-2040-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82w356lezo,"US Senior Advisor for Africa Massad Boulos has said that President Donald Trump values Africa, despite announcing sweeping aid cuts that have caused considerable humanitarian distress across the continent.

Trump announced the aid freeze on his first day in office in January in line with his ""America First"" foreign policy, while Trump's recent tariffs have raised fears of the end of a trade deal between the US and Africa meant to boost economic growth.

But Mr Boulos told BBC's Newsday that Africa was ""very important"" to Trump and downplayed reports that the US was planning to close some of its missions in the continent.

""He highly values Africa and African people,"" Mr Boulos added.

The aid cuts have affected health programmes across Africa, including shipments of critical medical supplies, including HIV drugs.

The majority of the US Agency for International Development's (USAID) programmes, which provided health and humanitarian assistance to vulnerable nations,have since been terminated.

Eight countries - six of them in Africa, including Nigeria, Kenya and Lesotho -could soon run out of HIV drugsfollowing the US decision to pause foreign aid, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.

There are fears that nearly six million more Africans could be pushed into extreme poverty next year following the aid cuts,according to the Institute for Security Studies(ISS) – a pan-African think-tank.

Earlier this month, eight people, including five children, died after walking for hours to seek treatment for cholera in South Sudan after aid cuts by the Trump administration forced local health clinics to close, the international charity Save the Children reported.

But Mr Boulos said those reported deaths could not be directly linked to the US aid cuts and said they were needed to ensure the money was being well used.

""It is absolutely necessary [for the US] to review some of these programmes for much more efficiency and transparency,"" Mr Boulos said.

""We have to make sure the [aid funds] are going to the right place and that we are getting the desired outcome,"" he added.

Mr Boulos, whose son is married to Trump's daughter, Tiffany, said several US companies had expressed an interest in exploiting minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo, followinghis recent trip to the resource-rich central African nation.

DR Congo, home to vast natural reserves like lithium which is essential for battery and electric vehicle production, has been battling Rwandan-backed M23 rebels, who have seized large areas of territory this year.

Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi believes US involvement in extracting the minerals could help quell the violence that has plagued the east of the country for nearly 30 years. Currently, DR Congo's mineral wealth isdominated by Chinese firms.

Mr Boulos said his country was also interested in exploring minerals in neighbouring Rwanda, but called on the country to first withdraw its troops from DR Congo and stop its support for the M23. Rwanda denies involvement in the conflict.

Asked if the US was only interested in benefiting economically from Africa and not its welfare, Boulos said ""our job is to promote the US interests and promote our strategic partnerships"".

Trump is also determined ""to end wars and establish peace"" across the world, the envoy said, citing the conflict in Sudan as a big concern for the US government.

Mr Boulos, who has served as Washington's senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs since December, also visited Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda in his trip.

He has business interests in Africa, including in a Nigeria-based company that distributes motor vehicles and equipment in West Africa.

The Lebanese-born businessman said Trump felt it was time to end the ""unfair advantage"" taken by other international players of Africa.

Responding to reports in the US media that the Trump administration was planning to close most of its diplomatic missions in Africa, Mr Boulos said this was ""not very accurate"", adding: ""Africa is very important to Trump.""

On the trade tariffs announced by Trump, Mr Boulos said they had ""zero net-effect"" for most African countries as they touched on ""small trade volumes"" from the continent.

""Many countries have lined up for negotiations and at the end of the day we want fairness and a win-win solution,"" he added.

The small southern African country of Lesotho was hit by the highest of the most recently announced tariffs - 50% - before they were paused for 90 days.

It has used theAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa)to become a major exporter of textiles, including jeans, to the US. This trade accounts for more than 10% of Lesotho's national income.

Agoa was set up by former Us President Bill Clinton in 2000 to encourage trade and investment in Africa but analysts fear that it is unlikely to be renewed by the current, Republican-dominated Congress.

Pahalgam: Rage and grief after 26 killed in Indian-administered Kashmir,Families are mourning loved ones killed by gunmen in one of India's most popular tourist destinations.,Asia,"India, Kashmir",Cherylann Mollan,2025-04-23T15:28:55.831Z,2025-04-23T15:28:55.831Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a4fd/live/de1494b0-203d-11f0-9ca7-e308e1ae9161.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a4fd/live/de1494b0-203d-11f0-9ca7-e308e1ae9161.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cze10y59j91o,"An Indian naval officer on honeymoon, a tourist guide who was sole breadwinner for his family, and a businessman holidaying with his wife and children were among the victims of the horrific attack that killed 26 people in Indian-administered Kashmir.

A group of gunmen opened fire on Tuesday on tourists at a resort in Pahalgam, a picturesque town in the Himalayas often described as the ""Switzerland of India"".

Visitors from different states in India were killed, others seriously injured - there is no official confirmation on the numbers yet from the government.

The attack was one of the deadliest in recent years in the troubled region, and it has shattered the lives of many.

The attack took place on Tuesday afternoon. Eyewitnesses told the BBC that tourists had gathered at Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow 5km (three miles) from Pahalgam, when they heard the sound of bullets ripping through the air.

They began to run for cover and in the chaos, some were injured or separated from their groups.

Veenu Bhai, who fractured his arm as he was trying to escape, told BBC Hindi that there was confusion and mayhem everywhere. Children could be heard screaming and no one knew what was going on, he said.

Priyadarshini, whose husband Prashant Satpathy was killed in the attack, told theIndian Express newspaperthat he was hit by a bullet as they were alighting from a ropeway.

JS Chandramouli, a retired banker who had travelled to Kashmir with his wife and four others, became separated from his group and his bullet-ridden body was found several hours later at the site of the attack, the newspaper reported.

Most of the victims were Hindu men.

Some eyewitnesses said it appeared the gunmen targeted non-Muslims but others have described the shooting as random. A local Muslim man was among the victims.

India's government has not given an official account on whether people were targeted on the basis of religion.

Himanshi, who was on honeymoon with her husband Vinay Narwal, an Indian naval officer, can be heard saying in a video that has now gone viral that one of the attackers asked her husband if he was a Muslim.

""When he said no, the man shot him dead,"" she said.

The couple married last week, on 16 April. On Wednesday, Himanshi bid a tearful farewell to her husband as he lay in a coffin draped with the Indian flag.

""He was the best man. I pray that his soul rests in peace and he has the best life wherever he is,"" she said.

Vinay's grandfather, Hawa Singh Narwal, told BBC Punjabi that his grandson had initially wanted to go to Switzerland for his honeymoon.

""But he did not get a visa,"" he said.

Asavari, the daughter of Santosh Jagdale - a businessman from Maharashtra state - told PTI news agency that the gunmen asked her father to recite an Islamic verse.

""When he failed to do so, they pumped three bullets into him, one in the head, one behind the ear and another in the back,"" she said.

She added that the attackers killed her uncle too, who was standing next to her.

Pallavi, whose husband Manjunath Rao was killed, told reporters that when she confronted the attackers and asked them to shoot her too, one of them said, ""I won't kill you. Go tell this to [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi.""

The tragedy has torn families apart and engulfed households in grief.

As they speak to journalists, many relatives break down in tears.

The mother of Syed Hussain Shah, a local man who took tourists on horse rides to earn a living and died in the attack, told ANI news agency that her son was the sole breadwinner of the family.

She was inconsolable when reporters asked her about her son. Reports said that hundreds of people attended Shah's funeral, including Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, whotoldreporters that the man was killed while trying to stop the attackers.

In the western state of Maharashtra, a family is struggling to come to terms with the sudden loss of three of its members.

Atul Mone, Sanjay Lele and Hemant Joshi, cousins who had gone to Kashmir with six other family members, were killed by the gunmen.

""We found out last night [about their deaths]. The family is in shock,"" a relative told BBC Marathi.

The brazen attack at one of its most popular tourist destinations has shocked India and been condemned by leaders around the world. People across India have been protesting.

In Indian-administered Kashmir, locals shut down markets, businesses and schools on Wednesday in protest at the attack. Some locals told the BBC that they feared tourists would be scared away, causing irreparable harm to their businesses and Kashmir's economy.

There's an eerie silence in areas that once bustled with tourist activity.

It's been more than 24 hours since the atrocity, and those affected are still struggling to come to terms with what's happened. A huge manhunt is under way for the militants suspected of carrying out the killings.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi cut short a foreign trip to return to Delhi for talks with security chiefs and other officials.

""Those responsible and behind such an act will very soon hear our response, loud and clear,"" Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said. ""We will not only reach those who have perpetrated this incident but also those who, sitting behind the scenes, have conspired to commit such acts on the soil of India.""

India has yet to say who it thinks carried out the killings. But after previous attacks it launched cross-border strikes, blaming militant groups it says are supported by Pakistan, which denies the accusation.

Observers say there is now a risk of fresh hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours if India takes a similar course of action.

Hawa Singh Narwal says he is full of rage and grief and wants ""exemplary punishment"" for the attackers.

""Today, I lost my grandson. Tomorrow, someone else will lose theirs [if such attacks don't stop],"" he told BBC Punjabi.

Asked about an upcoming meeting between the countries, Bessent said it would be an ""incredible opportunity"" to strike an agreement, if China was ""serious"" on making its economy less dependent on manufacturing exports.

""China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change because we need rebalancing too,"" he said.

The comments come as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated in recent weeks.

US President Donald Trump has brought in a number of tariffs on imports to the US which he has said are aimed at increasing US manufacturing and protecting jobs.

These include import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods, but China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.

Speaking at the Institute of International Finance conference on Wednesday, Bessent, said it was a ""matter of impetus and will"".

""There is an opportunity for a big deal here, that the US is looking to rebalance to more manufacturing, the identity of that would be less consumption.

""If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth, and a rebalancing towards a domestic economy… if they want to rebalance, let's do it together.""

The comments come after Bessent reportedly said on Tuesday that heexpected a de-escalation of the trade warand that the current situation was ""not a joke"".

Trump has also said he is optimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".

Tensions between China and the US have shaken investors, with violent swings in share prices and sharp falls in the dollar.

Stocks surged on Wednesday on hopes that trade tensions between the US and China could soon ease.

Aside from the trade war, Bessent called on the IMF and the World Bank to refocus on the core missions of economic stability and development, arguing that they had strayed too far into vanity projects such as ""climate change, gender and social issue"".

""These issues are not the IMF's mission,"" he said.

Tensions between the countries have rattled financial markets, with both sides introducing strong tariffs on each other.

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said that he was ""very frankly encouraged"" by Bessent's comments on the IMF and World Bank.

Although Mr Bessent said the IMF and the World Bank are ""falling short"" he did not call for the US to withdraw from the institutions as some conservatives have lobbied for.

He said the Trump administration will use US influence at these institutions and ""push them to accomplish their important mandates"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywg25ykqno
Dominican Republic detains pregnant Haitian women in hospital swoop,The move is part of the government's plan to curb undocumented migration from neighbouring Haiti.,Latin America,"Haiti, Dominican Republic, Migration",Yang Tian,2025-04-23T03:53:24.778Z,2025-04-23T11:37:25.098Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4e82/live/6cf8fa30-1fea-11f0-b7d2-4fd037c6ca5f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4e82/live/6cf8fa30-1fea-11f0-b7d2-4fd037c6ca5f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8egxlxz5po,"The Dominican Republic says it deported more than 130 Haitian women and children on the first day of a crackdown on undocumented migrants in hospitals.

Dominican authorities said 48 pregnant women, 39 new mothers and 48 children were removed on Monday.

The swoop is one of 15 measures announced by President Luis Abinader to cut the number of undocumented migrants in his country, which shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti.

Abinader's government has been criticised for its harsh treatment of Haitian migrants, many of whom are fleeing the extreme gang violence in their country.

Those deported were taken to a detention centre to have their biometric data and fingerprints taken, before being handed to Haitian authorities at the Elías Piña border crossing.

The Dominican immigration department said the women and their children ""were treated with dignity and given food"".

Immigration officials added that those detained were taken to the border in buses ""with padded seats, safety belts, air conditioning, curtains, CCTV cameras, bathrooms, and a luggage area"".

Officials also said all were deported after they had been ""discharged from hospital and there were no risks to their health"".

However, the Dominican College of Physicians called the deportations ""inhumane"" and said that checking people's migratory status and detaining them in hospitals would lead to undocumented migrants being too afraid to seek urgent medical care.

At least half a million Haitians are estimated to live in the Dominican Republic, which has a population of 11m.

One study suggests close to 33,000 Haitian mothers gave birth in Dominican hospitals last years.

Many Dominicans complain of the additional strain on public services, including health.

President Abinader said earlier this month that his country's ""generosity will not be exploited"", and that public hospitals would be required to check patients' IDs, work permits and proof of residence.

He said that those not in possession of the necessary papers would be deported after being treated.

The Dominican Republic has deported more than 80,000 people to Haiti in the first three months of this year, according to AFP news agency.

Rights groups have described the deportations as ""cruel"".

More than 5,600 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti in 2024 and many hospitals have had to close after being stormed by gang members.

On Monday, the UN special representative to Haiti, María Isabel Salvador, warned that a recent surge in gang violence meant the country was approaching a ""point of no return"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8egxlxz5po
"Gertrude Torkornoo: Suspension of Ghana's chief justice is 'abuse of power', says opposition",This is the first time in Ghana's history that a president has removed a chief justice from office.,Africa,"Ghana, Africa",Thomas Naadi,2025-04-23T14:13:09.719Z,2025-04-23T14:13:09.719Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e46b/live/be56c7d0-2031-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e46b/live/be56c7d0-2031-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1758n1gnldo,"Opposition MPs in Ghana have fiercely condemned the suspension of the country's chief justice, accusing President John Mahama of trying to ""pack the courts"" with justices who are sympathetic to the governing party, the NDC.

Gertrude Torkornoo was removed from her post on Wednesday - the first time a chief justice has been suspended in the country's history.

The action was taken after three petitions, which made allegations against Ms Torkornoo, were filed.

The content of the petitions has not been made public and Ms Torkornoo is yet to comment openly on the matter.

Mahama's supporters have backed the move as a long overdue move to clean up the judiciary.

But it was condemned by the opposition as ""nothing short of a brazen judicial coup, a reckless abuse of executive power, and a direct assault on the independence of Ghana's judiciary"".

On Tuesday, a statement from the presidency said the chief justice was asked to step aside so that the allegations against her could be investigated.

Since the suspension was announced, two more petitions have been filed against Ms Torkornoo.

Former attorney general Godfred Yeboah Dame told the BBC he thought the suspension was a ""complete charade... the biggest assault on the [judiciary] in the nation's history"".

Before Ms Torkornoo was suspended, lawyers filed at least two lawsuits challenging the legality of the procedure being used by the president.

By law the president should have given copies of the petition to the chief justice before suspending her, which he initially failed to do. However, he did later make them available to her.

The caucus of opposition MPs says that by suspending the chief justice before the Supreme Court had ruled on these lawsuits, Mahama had ""violated"" due process.

But some Ghanaians support the president's move.

Dr Tony Aidoo, Ghana's former ambassador to the Netherlands, told radio station Joy News: ""I think the president is protecting the judiciary in Ghana from the actions of a person who does not behave in a manner that should keep her there... if there's a stench in the room you have to let in fresh air.""

Some accuse the Supreme Court under Ms Torkornoo of siding with former President Nana Akufo-Addo and his party on several high-profile political cases.

For example, last year, the justices ruled that thespeaker's decision to declare four MPs' seats vacant was unconstitutional.

Ghana has had 15 chief justices, whose job involves overseeing the administration of justice in the country.

Those that came before Ms Torkornoo ended their term by retiring - none have been suspended or permanently removed.

Chief justices can only be removed from office on a few grounds, such as incompetence or misbehaviour.

Ms Torkornoo is Ghana's third female chief justice and was nominated in 2023 by Akufo-Addo.

According to Reuters news agency, Ms Torkornoo survived a removal request earlier this year when Akufo-Addo said a petition to have her dismissed had ""several deficiencies"".

A five-member committee has now been set up to investigate the current allegations against Ms Torkornoo.

Lithuanian capital Vilnius unveils invasion evacuation plan,Plans for the evacuation of Vilnius were published as fears over Russia's military ambitions continue to grow. ,Europe,"Russia, Lithuania, Vilnius, Nato",Sean Seddon,2025-04-23T15:36:13.276Z,2025-04-23T15:36:13.276Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c078/live/1cea43c0-2051-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c078/live/1cea43c0-2051-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq80g3zlvdvo,"Officials in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, have unveiled an evacuation plan that would be used in the event of an invasion of the city.

It sets out how the city's 540,000 residents would be ordered to leave if it were close to being overrun by enemy forces.

The plan's publication comes amid heightened fears over Russia's military ambitions in the region, in light of the ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Lithuania, along with fellow Baltic states Estonia and Latvia, has long warned about the threat of Russian aggression and has heavily invested in defence in recent years.

Vilnius is located close to the 679-km (422 mile) border which Lithuania shares with Belarus, a staunch Russian ally.

Belarus hosts thousands of Russian troops and was used as a springboard for the failed February 2022 attempt to capture the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.

Lithuania - a member of the Nato military alliance - also shares a border with Kaliningrad, a heavily militarised Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea.

The evacuation plan unveiled on Wednesday identifies 150 routes out of Vilnius and assigns neighbourhoods with specific evacuation points, Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reported.

Residents would be told to evacuate via SMS and siren warnings, with a dedicated app communication system also under development.

The plan calls for some roads and a bridge to be expanded in order to allow the safe and rapid flow of people out of the city.

Vilnius Mayor Valdas Benkunskas stressed that any evacuation would be a last resort should a military defence of the city fail.

He said the publication of the plan should not cause ""panic"" and stressed it did not imply an increased threat.

The plan incorporates elements of how Ukraine responded to Russia's invasion, especially the ways in which Kyiv endured the early days of full-scale invasion.

Officials said the Vilnius plan was primarily developed with an invasion in mind but said it could also be deployed in the event of a natural disaster, nuclear attack or a major collapse of essential infrastructure.

Lithuania was formerly part of the Soviet Union and declared its independence in 1990, after which it sought closer ties with Western Europe, including joining the European Union.

It has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine and, like its Baltic neighbours, has repeatedly warned of the threat the Kremlin's expansionist ambitions could pose to the region.

Belarus and Russia are due to hold joint large-scale military drills in September, which could potentially see troops stationed close to Lithuania's border.

Military strategists have long considered the so-called Suwałki gap - a narrow stretch along Lithuania's border, which runs between Kaliningrad and Belarus - a potential vulnerability in Nato's defences

Its occupation would cut off land routes linking Poland to Lithuania, and onto the rest of the Baltic countries.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq80g3zlvdvo

The attack occurred on Wednesday morning in the south-central city of Marhanets in the Dnipropetrovsk region, across a river from the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

President Volodymyr Zelensky called it ""an egregiously brutal attack – and an absolutely deliberate war crime"" on an ""ordinary bus...clearly a civilian target.""

He said most of the injured were women who worked at a mining and processing plant.

The strike came as top Trump officials pulled out of talks in London between UK, Europe and Ukraine aimed at securing a ceasefire.

The US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff had been due to attend, but were later announced to have pulled out. They were replaced by Trump's Ukraine envoy, Gen Keith Kellogg, who referred to Wednesday's talks as ""technical meetings"".

Zelensky said on Wednesday the Ukrainian delegation was continuing talks with partners.

""Ukraine has repeatedly said that it does not exclude any of the formats that can lead to a ceasefire and, subsequently, to real peace. Stopping the killings is the number one task,"" he said.

He shared pictures of the bus attack, which showed the vehicle with a hole punctured through its roof, doors off their hinges and glass scattered across its floor.

Russia has not commented on the attack.

There have also been drone strikes on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city located in the country's east, for a second consecutive day.

Russian President Vladimir Putin had declared a 30-hour ceasefire for Easter Sunday. Ukraine had said it would mirror Russia's actions. Each side accused the other of breaking the truce.

Last month, Moscow came up with a long list of conditions in response to a full ceasefire that had been agreed by the US and Ukraine.

The US has been holding talks with Russia and separately with Ukrainian and European officials to broker a truce.

Witkoff, a property mogul and Donald Trump's special envoy, has acted as a conduit between the White House and the Kremlin in recent months.

He is set to return to Moscow this week for another meeting with Putin. Rubio said on Wednesday he would focus on these talks in Moscow.

It comes after reports the US is considering proposing to recognise Crimea as Russian territory as a means to bring an end to fighting, which has been ruled out by Zelensky.

Crimea, internationally recognised as part of Ukraine, has been under Russian occupation since 2014.

US Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday repeated President Donald Trump's recent assertion that the US would walk away from brokering further Russia-Ukraine talks if Moscow or Kyiv did not agree to a deal.

Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have been killed or injured on all sides since then.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg857d844xo
Trump hints at softening China tariffs and says no plan to sack Fed boss Jerome Powell,"His comments come amid a trade war with Beijing, and after his attacks on the US central bank's boss.",Business,"International Business, US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, Donald Trump",João da Silva,2025-04-23T01:25:44.870Z,2025-04-23T09:10:40.315Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2cde/live/64d8f980-2027-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2cde/live/64d8f980-2027-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86jyw5jp6go,"US President Donald Trump has appeared to soften his recent comments on China and the head of the US Federal Reserve after recent clashes as he pursues his economic agenda.

Trump said he has ""no intention of firing"" Jerome Powell after repeatedly criticising the head of the central bank, but added that he would like Powell to be ""a little more active"" on cutting interest rates.

Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump also said he was optimistic about improving trade relations with China.

He said the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".

The president's tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. This is a pillar of his economic agenda - as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.

Trump has ratcheted the rate on Chinese goods up to 145% - sparking reciprocal measures from Beijing and warnings from economists about the global impact of a trade war.

In his comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he would be ""very nice"" in negotiations with Beijing - in the hope of securing a trade deal.

Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly said he expected a de-escalation of the trade war, which he said was unsustainable. Responding to comments from China, he said the current situation was ""not a joke"".

The trade war has led to turbulence in financial markets around the world - to which Trump's comments on Powell have also contributed.

The Fed has not cut rates so far this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year, a stance Trump has heavily criticised.

Last week, the president intensified his attacks on the Fed chief, calling him ""a major loser"". The comments sparked a selloff of stocks, bonds and the US dollar - though markets have since been recovering from those losses.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Friday that Trump was looking into whether it would be possible to sack Powell - who he first nominated to lead the central bank in 2017. Powell was then renewed in 2021 by Joe Biden.

It is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire the Fed chair. No other US president has tried to do so.

Most major Asian stock markets were higher on Wednesday as investors appeared to welcome the latest remarks.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose about 1.9%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed by around 2.2%, while mainland China's Shanghai Composite was down less than 0.1%.

That came after US shares made gains on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending Tuesday's session up 2.5% and the Nasdaq rose 2.7%.

US futures were also trading higher overnight. Futures markets give an indication of how financial markets will perform when they open for trading.

Investors feared that pressure on Powell to lower interest rates could cause prices to rise at a time when trade tariffs are already seen boosting inflation.

Trade tensions between the world's biggest economies, as well as US tariffs on other countries around the world, have triggered uncertainty about the global economy. Those concerns triggered turmoil in financial markets in recent weeks.

On Tuesday,the forecast for US economic growth for this yearwas given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by tariffs.

The sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a ""significant slowdown"" in global growth, the Fund predicted.

Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.

His administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.

China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to ""fight to the end"".

The Chinese government has not yet officially responded to the latest statements from the Trump administration.

However, an article in the state-controlled Global Times on Wednesday quoted commentators who said the remarks showed that the US is beginning to realise the tariffs do more harm than good to America's economy.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86jyw5jp6go
Gaza health ministry denies manipulating death toll figures,Three thousand names were removed from an official list of those killed in Israel's offensive.,Middle East,"Israel-Gaza war, Israel, Hamas",Yolande Knell,2025-04-22T23:34:41.814Z,2025-04-22T23:34:41.814Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/30b0/live/bafeccd0-1f79-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/30b0/live/bafeccd0-1f79-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25x35476yo,"At al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Alam Hirzallah resigns himself to a grim task: registering the deaths of the wife and two children of his grieving cousin.

His family brought the bodies here on an electric rickshaw or tuk-tuk. They found them in their house in eastern Gaza City after Israeli shelling hit the family home. Asma Hirzallah, Mayar, 5, and Abdullah, 3, were killed.

""The hospital asked for their full names and ID numbers,"" explains Alam, referring to the numbers all Palestinians are given in a population registry administered by Israel.

""They gave us a paper to confirm they were martyred and told us to come back for the death certificate. Now we don't know where to go to bury them as the cemeteries are in areas under Israeli control.""

At least 51,266 people have been killed in the 18 months since the Gaza war began, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, with nearly a third of the dead aged under 18.

Israel has repeatedly challenged the accuracy of the Palestinian fatalities list - in terms of overall numbers, and in particular, the demographic breakdown - claiming it is used as Hamas propaganda. The figures are cited with attribution, by UN agencies and widely in the media.

The list does not distinguish between civilians and members of Palestinian armed groups who are killed in the war, and Israel has accused Hamas of inflating the percentages of women and children.

Recently, several media reports have raised questions about the reliability of the statistics by highlighting anomalies between the August and October 2024 and March 2025 lists of fatalities.  The reports focus on how some 3,000 names of people originally identified as fatalities were removed from later revised lists.

A Gazan health official, Zaher al-Wahidi, denied to the BBC that victims had vanished or that there was a lack of transparency, insisting: ""The health ministry works towards having accurate data with high credibility.

""In every list that gets shared, there is a greater verification and revision of the list.  We cannot say that the health ministry removes names.  It's not a removal process, rather it is a revision and verification process.""

So how are the statistics gathered and how accurate are they?

Until the first months of this war, the number of people killed in Gaza was calculated from counting bodies that arrived in hospitals - like those of Asma Hirzallah and her children.

Medics could log data for all deaths into a centralised computer system, which was based at a Ministry of Health office at al-Shifa hospital, with a back-up at al-Rantissi hospital.

However, as conditions became more chaotic and medical sites repeatedly came under attack, this method became less reliable. During the war, Israel says it has targeted hospitals – which have protected status under international law – because Hamas has used them to hide its fighters and infrastructure – something the armed group denies.

From the start of 2024, Gazan health officials introduced online forms which relatives could use to report their loved ones dead or missing.

According to Mr Wahidi, the head of statistics at the health ministry, most of the names which were recently removed from the official list as part of a new checking process had originally been submitted using these forms.  He says that names which are taken off may later be added back

""A judicial committee was set up and it looks into all of the cases received,"" Mr Wahidi says. ""To ensure credibility we verify the data so that it will be accurate.""

During investigations by the judicial committee, some people were found to have died of natural causes – not directly because of the war.  When Gazans die from lack of medical treatment, malnutrition or hypothermia, Mr Wahidi clarifies ""these cases are indirect and do not get added to the lists.""

Other individuals were wrongly listed as dead but then found to have been among thousands of Gazans imprisoned by Israel.

Mr Wahidi confirms that in August and then October, a total of more than 3,000 names were removed from the list, saying this was a precautionary measure pending full checks.

For some pro-Israel groups, such as media watchdog HonestReporting, this was strong indication of ""deliberate manipulation, not honest error"".

There had been a widespread presumption that only checked names were included on the online lists published.

""It seems like they're actually updating the lists more in real time, as more information appears,"" says Professor Mike Spagat of Royal Holloway College, chair of Every Casualty Counts, an independent civilian casualty monitoring organisation. ""We should have regarded the previous lists as a little bit more provisional than I had assumed.""

However, he says he detects no attempt by health officials to mislead and sees the changes as ""a big clean-up operation"".

He points out that the latest modifications to the list led to a small increase in the percentage of adult males among those killed, countering the idea that the original inclusion of the 3,000-plus names was done in an attempt to exaggerate the proportion of women and children.

The Gaza health ministry says it has also recently audited data in its official fatalities list from hospital mortuaries for errors and omissions.

When deaths were registered by friends or neighbours, it says, they often did not know the ID numbers of those killed or their full names - which include the father and grandfather's names. In some cases, this resulted in the wrong people being marked as dead.

Thousands of bodies that are still under the rubble left by Israeli air strikes, as well as about 900 which are unidentified, are not currently included in the health ministry list, the ministry says.

However, the recent two-month ceasefire - which allowed hundreds of thousands of displaced Gazans to return to what was left of their homes - saw nearly 800 corpses being retrieved, identified and registered.

In late January,the BBC filmed workers from the Hamas-run Civil Defence agencyas they set about retrieving human remains which had been left for months in Wadi Gaza - also known as the Netzarim Corridor – after a pullout by Israeli forces.

With no DNA testing available in Gaza, each corpse was given a serial number. Long forms were filled in to log the bones and clothing collected to try to identify the dead.

""We look for distinctive personal belongings: a watch, a necklace or an earring. When we search the bodies, it's very possible that we'll find a driver's licence or ID card,"" said Sameh Khalifa, who led the team.

""Even a broken tooth can be a distinguishing mark that will help a family recognise a missing loved one.""

Since the resumption of Israel's military offensive in Gaza on 18 March, the numbers killed have risen daily.

Israel periodically estimates the number of Palestinian fighters killed. At the start of this year, it assessed that 20,000 members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad were among the dead. In mid-April it said there had been ""more than 100 targeted eliminations"" in the past month.

Israel does not provide its figures for civilian deaths in Gaza and has not officially challenged any of the names on the local health ministry casualty list.

The war began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas led a cross-border attack on southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 250 people into captivity in Gaza. Since then, the Israeli military says that 408 of its soldiers have been killed in combat.

International journalists, including the BBC, are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently, so are unable to verify figures from either side.

We rely heavily on local Palestinian journalists working with us to access information about deadly attacks - interviewing witnesses as well as visiting bomb sites and hospital mortuaries to film footage, which is shared with us.

Overall, the numbers killed in the past year and a half dwarf those from previous rounds of fighting in the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict and yet, for the moment, there is no end in sight to the war.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25x35476yo

Advance polling stations were open across the country for four days, from Friday to Monday, over the Easter long weekend. Poll workers reported long lines, with two million people casting their ballots last Friday alone.

With less than one week to go before election day on 28 April, federal leaders are now in the final stretch of campaigning.

Voters will consider which party should govern the country amid an ongoing trade war with the US and President Donald Trump's repeated comments about making Canada the 51st US state.

Elections Canada, the organisation which runs federal elections, said 7.3 million Canadians - about a quarter of eligible voters - had cast their ballots, marking a 25% increase from early votes in the previous 2021 election.

Mail-in voting is up as well, with over 754,000 returning their special ballots to the  federal agency. That is more than the 660,000 that did so in 2021.

Latest polling suggests Liberals have  a 5-point lead over the main opposition Conservative party, as campaigning enters its last stretch.

Liberal leader Mark Carney held events in Prince Edward Island and Quebec, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had a rally in Vaughan, a suburb of Toronto, on Tuesday evening.

Carney, the former central banker of Canada and the UK, has touted his party as the best option to deal with Trump and his tariffs.

""Pierre Poilievre has no plan to stand up to President Trump,"" Carney told supporters on Tuesday.

The US president has implemented blanket 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, with an exemption on products covered by the USMCA - a North American free trade deal.

Canada is also hit with global US tariffs on steel and aluminium, and cars.

The northern country does a majority of its trade with the US, and the tariffs have already resulted in thousands of temporary layoffs in Canada's auto sector.

A win for the Liberals would mark a dramatic reversal of fortune for the party, which had been polling at just 20% when former Liberal leader and prime minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation in late January.

Their main rivals, the Conservatives, have focused their campaigning on Canadians' desire for change following nine years of leadership under Trudeau.

At rallies and events across the country, Poilievre has honed in on issues like housing, crime and the high cost of living, while criticising the Liberals for government overspending.

""It's time for the government to start pinching pennies,"" Poilievre said on Tuesday as he unveiled his party's platform, before adding: ""We can choose change. We can choose hope. We can choose our future.""

Polls suggest the Bloc Quebecois, a party advocating for Quebec separatism that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, is in third place, with the left-leaning New Democratic Party trailing behind in fourth.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3129z5kyko
Who will be the next Pope? The top candidates in an unpredictable process,Several names are prominent as cardinals prepare to gather in the Vatican to elect Pope Francis' successor. ,Europe,"Catholicism, Vatican City, Roman Catholic Church, Religion, Italy","Aleem Maqbool, Rebecca Seales & Paul Kirby",2025-04-22T13:48:18.018Z,2025-04-23T15:39:59.255Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6068/live/e2486fe0-1f78-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6068/live/e2486fe0-1f78-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxk40ndk1o,"Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics.

It also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.

The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.

With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.

For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European.

And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively ""progressive"" or ""traditionalist"".

For those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.

Could the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?

Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.

Nationality: Italian

Age: 70

Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis – making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.

Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.

He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.

But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favourin the Republic of Ireland ""a defeat for humanity"".

The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: ""He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.""

Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.

Nationality: Filipino

Age: 67

Could the next pope come from Asia?

Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience – meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.

The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals – which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.

He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the ""Asian Francis"" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.

He has opposed abortion rights, calling them ""a form of murder"" – a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.

But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its ""severe"" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling ""branded"", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.

The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.

Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: ""I treat it like a joke! It's funny.""

Nationality: Congolese

Age: 65

It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.

He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that ""unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil"".

Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.

But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: ""Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.""

Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.

Nationality: Ghanaian

Age: 76

If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.

Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. ""I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,"" he told the BBC in 2013.

Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because ""those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters"".

He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.

Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.

A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.

Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.

In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.

In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.

Nationality: Hungarian

Age: 72

A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.

He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.

The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.

Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.

His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the ""illiberal democracy"" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.

Nationality: Italian

Age: 83

Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.

The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.

His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said ""death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something"".

Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.

Nationality: German

Age: 71

Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.

The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.

He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.

But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.

Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.

Nationality: Canadian

Age: 80

Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.

For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.

As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.

Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.

He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that ""Christ is male, the Church is feminine"".

Nationality: American

Age: 69

Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?

Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.

Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.

He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.

Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.

He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.

Nationality: Guinean

Age: 79

Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.

The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.

He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.

While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.

Nationality: Italian

Age: 60

Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.

Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as ""the heart of the life of this world"".

Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.

However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.

Nationality: Canadian

Age: 78

Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.

Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.

He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.

Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.

Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxk40ndk1o
Five cards China holds in a trade war with the US,"From rare earths to billions in US debt, here's what China has in its arsenal - and how strong they are.",Asia,"World of Business, Trump tariffs, China",Koh Ewe,2025-04-23T21:50:09.046Z,2025-04-23T21:50:09.046Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f017/live/1a4c4200-1f2d-11f0-9612-0d839e1e9bdc.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f017/live/1a4c4200-1f2d-11f0-9612-0d839e1e9bdc.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kxe1m1y26o,"A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing.

Chinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would ""fight to the end"".

Here's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.

China is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.

With more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.

Beijing is still fumbling with the keys becauseChinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to""silver trains""for travelling retirees, that could change.

And Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.

The leadership may ""very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression"", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.

China also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.

Still, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.

The economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.

The Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to ""weather storms together"".

President Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: ""The sky will not fall.""

China has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.

Under Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance.

It has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI.

Examples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which wascelebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.

Recently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.

US companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.

Chinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.

That unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.

Ever since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order.

It has pumped billions into acontentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.

The expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.

American farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier.

""The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once‑captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,"" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute.

The US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.

That doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.

Following reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against""reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests"".

That would be animpossible choicefor much of the world

""We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],"" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.

Trump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to ""medicine"".

But he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.

Trump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".

So, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.

China also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.

Some argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a ""weapon"".

But experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.

Rather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.

China will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds ""only up to a point"", Dr Zhang says. ""China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.""

What China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.

China has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.

Beijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.

China accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

While Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.

In 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.

The fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.

""Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,"" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment,told the BBCpreviously.

""The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kxe1m1y26o
Death of Pope Francis: Will the next pontiff be from Africa?,"Despite having the world's fastest-growing Catholic population, odds are against Africa producing the next pontiff. ",Africa,"Catholicism, Pope Francis, Roman Catholic Church, Africa",Lebo Diseko,2025-04-22T23:13:55.425Z,2025-04-22T23:13:55.425Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a234/live/d07e2200-2013-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a234/live/d07e2200-2013-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y65nw5lgvo,"If the sole predictor of who would become the next pope was where the Catholic Church is growing fastest, then it is almost certain he would hail from Africa.

The continent's Catholic population is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else, representing more than half of the global increase.

While there have been at least three pontiffs from Africa, the last - Pope Gelasius I - died more than 1,500 years ago, many would argue it is high time for another.

When the cardinals who vote for the leader of the Roman Catholic Church - known as the cardinal-electors - meet at the Vatican to choose Pope Francis' successor, will these facts influence their decision making?

""I think that it will be great to have an African pope,"" Father Stan Chu Ilo, a Nigerian Catholic priest and associate professor at DePaul University in Chicago, told the BBC, arguing that the leadership of the Church should better reflect the make-up of the global congregation.

But the cleric admitted it was more likely that the cardinals would pick someone who already had a high profile - ""someone who is already an influential voice"".

""The challenge is that you don't have any senior African clergy holding any important position today at the Vatican, and that poses a problem,"" he said.

However, he also said that: ""Cardinal [Robert] Sarah of Guinea and Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo [Besungu] of DR Congo have become prominent voices in global Catholicism within the last two years.""

And he noted that Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson had held different roles at the Vatican, endearing him to many people around the world.

He remains a strong contender for the position, while in 2005 Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze was also a potential candidate in the conclave that led to the election of Pope Benedict XVI.

This is despite Pope Francis increasing the proportion of cardinals from sub-Saharan Africa from 8% when he was elected in 2013 to 12% a decade later, according to US-based Pew Research Center.

""How it has come to this point for the continent of Africa and the Catholic Church is still something that surprises many of us, given Pope Francis's openness to Africa,"" Fr Chu Ilo said.

Francis visited 10 countries in Africa during his pontificate - a time that marked a dramatic increase in the number of Catholics on the continent. The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023, making up 20% of the worldwide congregation.

But some African Catholics do not like this emphasis on origin - like Father Paulinus Ikechukwu Odozor, a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.

For the Nigerian-born Catholic priest it just smacks of tokenism.

""It's like people are saying, 'OK, so Africans are growing in these numbers, so why don't we give them a pope,'"" he told me.

""I have never been one to think that just because you come from Africa, or because you come from Europe, therefore you are prime candidate.

""No matter where you come from, as soon as you are elected, everybody's issues become your issue.  You have one concern, to build up the body of Christ, no matter where the people are, no matter how many they are, in whatever context they are.""

The most important thing, he told the BBC, was for the pope to be ""the chief theologian of the Church"".

""The pope must be somebody who knows tradition very well"" and was able to use that to give people direction, he said.

In his view, more needs to be done to ensure that matters affecting the faithful in Africa are taken seriously by those in positions of power at the Vatican.

He admitted that at times it felt ""as if Africans don't matter, or it's as if their faith is seen as a little bit below par, or counterfeit, and should not be taken seriously"".

""When Africans feel that their issues are not on the table as they should be, then people begin to ask, well, maybe we can only get ourselves heard or seen if we have our own man there.""

Pope Francis has been praised for his understanding of the poor and marginalised -which made him particularly loved in Africa.

For example, he spoke out against what he saw as the plundering of natural resources in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast country which is home to Africa's largest Catholic community with almost 55 million believers.

His role as peacemaker has also been commended - he went to great lengths to heal divisions following the brutal civil war in the Central African Republic, famously giving a ride on his popemobile to the imam who invited him to pray at a mosque in Bangui in 2015. He also kissed the feet of South Sudan's rival leaders four years later in an attempt to end that country's civil war.

But Pope Francis did face a backlash from the African Church for his stance on LGBT issues.

Africa bishops rejected his 2023 declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples.

The Vatican clarified that the blessings ""neither approve nor justify the situation in which these people find themselves"", and that ""in several countries there are strong cultural and even legal issues that require time and pastoral strategies that go beyond the short term"".

It is an issue that seems to unite the continent, where homosexual relationships are outlawed in many countries.

The three African cardinals, mentioned by observers as possible, if not top, contenders - Turkson, Sarah and Besungu - are all clear in their rejection of a change on this issue.

Congolese Cardinal Besungu has said ""unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil"".

Cardinal Sarah, an arch traditionalist, has been damning about the West's liberal attitudes, telling a Synod in 2015: ""What Nazi-Fascism and Communism were in the 20th Century, Western homosexual and abortion ideologies and Islamic fanaticism are today.""

And while Cardinal Turkson has been critical of Ghana's move to impose harsh penalties on LGBT people, he toes the line that same-sex relationships are ""objectively sinful"".

Nonetheless Fr Odozor agreed that despite an increase in the number of cardinals from the African continent, they lack real power in the Church.

And both clerics interviewed by the BBC pointed to an issue that could hinder efforts that Pope Francis had made to make the leadership of the Church more representative - and the possibility of getting a pontiff from Africa.

""There is still that question of racism in the Church that we never even talk about,"" Fr Odozor said.

""That could undermine someone, no matter how papal he is or what he does, he will be seen simply as an African pope.""

As Pope Francis appointed 108 of the 135 cardinals eligible to vote in the conclave, there is a good chance they will choose someone whose emphasis is also on reaching out to the poor and disenfranchised.

It is an approach Fr Chu Ilo called a ""poor-first"" outlook, with a focus on being ""a listening Church"".

But, as when Pope Francis was elected, he said the outcome would be unpredictable.

""I will answer like a good priest,"" he told me chuckling, when asked for his prediction.

""I would pray that God will give us a pope who will continue with the outlook of Francis, and I'll pray that such a person comes from Africa.""

Tundu Lissu - the fiery Tanzanian political survivor pushing for reforms,Tundu Lissu has survived against the political odds over the years but has now been charged with treason.,Africa,"Tanzania, Africa",Basillioh Rukanga & Alfred Lasteck,2025-04-23T23:20:49.396Z,2025-04-24T12:54:31.701Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/35db/live/6d340e20-203c-11f0-99e1-773f439bd3c0.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/35db/live/6d340e20-203c-11f0-99e1-773f439bd3c0.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05zgd00eko,"Shot 16 times in an assassination attempt in 2017, Tindu Lissu is the great survivor of Tanzanian politics - and one of its most persecuted politicians.

But some are asking whether he has now reached the the end of the line.

Lissu, the leader of the main opposition party, Chadema, is back in the limelight after being charged with treason - a crime for which the maximum sentence is the death penalty.

Still, he is undeterred. Despite the enormous risk, he believes he can pressure the government to institute reforms, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections in October.

But can he weather the storm in a harsh political environment, and against what he believes are politically driven charges?

His party has been disqualified from the elections and he has been in detention for the past two weeks.

In September last year, Lissu told the BBC that nothing would come on a silver platter, and it would take courage to demand reforms ""on the streets and in the villages"".

To achieve his goals, he felt he had to take over Chadema's leadership.

A fiery politician, Lissu was critical of the way the party was being run, accusing then chairman Freeman Mbowe of being too reconciliatory towards the government.

In an intense race, he ousted Mbowe from the post.

After just three months at the helm of Chadema, Lissu was this month arrested and detained for a speech allegedly calling for the public to launch a rebellion and disrupt the elections.

He was not allowed to enter a plea on the treason charge but pleaded not guilty to a separate charge of publishing false information.

Prior to his arrest, he had been holding gatherings across the country with a rallying call of ""no reforms, no elections"".

He said the current system was rigged in favour of the ruling CCM party, adding that without reforms, there was no point in taking part in the elections.

He was due to appear at Kisutu magistrates' court in Dar es Salaam on Thursday. There was tight security around the court and elsewhere in the city.

Chadema said more of party officials, including deputy chairman John Heche and secretary general John Mnyika, were arrested on their way to the court.

The court ordered the case to be heard virtually but Lissu did not appear before it, with the case going on in the presence of his lawyers. The hearing will continue on Monday.

Lissu cannot seek bail because he has been charged with treason.

His international lawyer, Robert Amsterdam, told the BBC that it was their ""mission to defend democracy"".

Yet it is no simple task - CCM has won every election since independence, and is unlikely to easily let go of its stranglehold on power.

There is also a rift in Chadema, with some members disagreeing with Lissu's strategy.

The party is barred from contesting October's election after it refused to comply with the electoral commission's requirement to sign a code of conduct.

The document's key objective ""is to ensure that political parties and their supporters behave well... and maintain peace and harmony"" during the elections.

Chadema sees the code of conduct as a ploy to contain the opposition, and it fears that state repression will continue.

In September a senior Chadema party official was abducted and brutally killed amid a wave of abductions of government critics.

During local elections in November, Chadema said thousands of its candidates were barred from participating. The ruling party won about 98% of the seats.

The government dismissed suggestions that the elections were not free and fair, saying they were held in accordance with the rules.

But for Lissu, the local elections justified his calls for reforms ahead of the presidential and parliamentary polls.

Campaign group Human Rights Watch has expressed similar fears, and has urged the government to end political repression.

The Catholic Church has added its voice to calls for the unconditional release of Lissu, and for fair elections.

But the arrest of opposition politicians has continued, despite Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa promising earlier this month that the authorities would ensure security and fairness in the polls.

The BBC has reached out to the government for comment.

President Samia Suluhu Hassan gave Tanzanians greater political freedom after she took office following the death in office of her predecessor John Magufuli in 2021.

However, Tanzania was once again ""beginning to see the wave of repression and state-orchestrated violence"" that characterised Magufuli's rule, Tanzanian political analyst Nicodemus Minde said.

It was during that era that Lissu survived an assassination attempt.

Before his arrest, Lissu said his party had a list of ""minimum but critical reforms that must be made to guarantee free elections"".

Mr Amsterdam, his lawyer, told the BBC that this included the formation of ""a truly independent national electoral commission with members unconnected to the government"" - and this must be enshrined in the constitution.

Chadema is also demanding that when there are electoral disputes, the burden of proof should lie with the commission to show that the vote was free and fair.

Lissu's strategy has come at a heavy cost to himself and Chadema, as a faction within the party, known as G-55,  has adopted a softer stance.

It has called for the party to contest theelections while pursuing talks with the government over its demands.

That is the approach taken by the second largest opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo.

Along with 16 fringe opposition parties, it has signed the code of conduct. Only Chadema has refused.

Lissu appears to see neighbouring Kenya - where mass protests last year forced the government to drop plans to increase taxes - as a model to follow.

At the time, he told the BBC that Tanzanians had not ""pressed hard enough for democratic reform"", and what Kenya went through in order to get [its] democratic dispensation is something that we need to do"".

Whether such a strategy would work is unclear, as many Tanzanians appear reluctant to publicly support a campaign that could rattle the government.

But Mr Amsterdam said the more intransigent the government, the more it would spur Chadema's supporters ""to push forward and engage in civil disobedience"".

He added that Chadema would use ""every legal and political tool"" to achieve change.

But political analyst Thomas Kibwana criticised Lissu's strategy, saying that with the term of the current parliament due to end in June there would not be enough time to give legal effect to any major reforms ahead of the October election.

He said it might be better for Chadema to wait until after the election.

Fulgence Massawe, the director of a legal rights organisation in Tanzania, told the BBC that Chadema's push for electoral reforms faced significant hurdles, but the party had the right to go to court to challenge its exclusion from the elections.

Mr Minde said that if Chadema remained shut out of the elections, the ruling party is likely to increase its already overwhelming majority in parliament.

The analyst added that Chadema might even lose its standing as the main opposition party, and ""of course nature pulls back and probably other opposition parties will seize this opportunity"".

It is a risk that Lissu and the party have chosen to take.

China's plastic surgery boom: 'I've had 100 operations and will never stop',"Face-scanning apps, social media influencers and toxic beauty standards are fuelling China's cosmetic surgery boom.",Asia,"Cosmetic surgery, China",Natalia Zuo,2025-04-22T22:08:23.786Z,2025-04-22T22:08:23.786Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bc36/live/3f82bd10-1f9b-11f0-afee-89ab52a5298c.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bc36/live/3f82bd10-1f9b-11f0-afee-89ab52a5298c.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj3xv653k6do,"Abby Wu was just 14 when she had cosmetic surgery for the first time.

After receiving hormone treatment for an illness, Abby's weight increased from 42kg (6 stone 8lbs) to 62kg (9 stone 11lbs) in two months.

The change hadn't gone unnoticed by her drama teacher.

""My teacher said, 'You were our star but now you're too fat. Either give up or lose weight fast,'"" recalls Abby, who was preparing for her drama exams at the time.

Abby's mother stepped in, taking her to get liposuction to remove fat from her belly and legs.

Abby remembers her mother's words as she waited in the clinic in a hospital gown, nervous about the impending operation.

""Just be brave and walk in. You'll become pretty once you're out.""

The surgery was traumatic. Abby was only given partial anaesthesia and remained conscious throughout.

""I could see how much fat was extracted from my body and how much blood I was losing,"" she says.

Now 35, Abby has gone on to have more than 100 procedures, costing half a million dollars.

She co-owns a beauty clinic in central Beijing and has become one of the most recognisable faces of China's plastic surgery boom.

But the surgeries have come at a physical cost.

Sitting in front of a mirror inside her luxury duplex apartment in Beijing, she gently dabs concealer onto bruises from a recent face-slimming injection - a procedure she undergoes monthly to help her face appear ""firmer and less chubby"" after three jaw reduction surgeries removed too much bone.

But she insists she has no regrets about the surgeries and believes her mother made the right decision all those years ago.

""The surgery worked. I became more confident and happier, day by day. I think my mum made the right call.""

Once seen as taboo, plastic surgery has exploded in popularity over the last 20 years in China, fuelled by rising disposable incomes and shifts in social attitudes, in large part driven by social media.

Every year, 20 million Chinese people pay for cosmetic procedures.

Overwhelmingly, it is young women who seek surgery. Eighty per cent of patients are women and the average age of someone receiving surgery is 25.

While appearance has always been important in Chinese culture, particularly for women, beauty standards in the country are changing.

For years, the most sought-after features were a blend of Western ideals, anime fantasy and K-Pop inspiration: The double eyelid, the sculpted jawline, the prominent nose, and the symmetrical face.

But lately, more disturbing procedures are on the rise - chasing an unrealistic, hyper-feminine, almost infantile ideal.

Botox is now injected behind the ears to tilt them forward, creating the illusion of a smaller, daintier face.

Lower eyelid surgery, inspired by the glassy gaze of anime heroines, widens the eyes for an innocent, childlike look.

Upper lip shortening narrows the space between lip and nose, thought to signal youth.

But much of this beauty is built for the screen. Under filters and ring lights, the results can look flawless. In real life, the effect is often uncanny - a face not quite human, not quite child.

Cosmetic surgery apps like SoYoung (New Oxygen) and GengMei (More Beautiful) - claiming to offer algorithm-driven analysis of ""facial imperfections"" - have been surging in popularity.

After scanning and assessing users' faces, they provide surgery recommendations from nearby clinics, taking a commission from each operation.

These and other beauty trends are shared and promoted by celebrities and influencers on social media, rapidly changing what's considered desirable and normal.

As one of China's earliest cosmetic surgery influencers, Abby has documented her procedures across major social media platforms and joined SoYoung soon after it launched.

Yet despite having undergone more than 100 procedures, when she scans her face using SoYoung's ""magic mirror"" feature, the app still points out ""imperfections"" and suggests a long list of recommended surgeries.

""It says I have eye bags. Get a chin augmentation? I've done that.""

Abby seems amused.

""Nose-slimming? Should I get another nose surgery?""

Unlike typical e-commerce sites, beauty apps like SoYoung also offer a social media function. Users share detailed before-and-after diaries and often ask superusers like Abby for their advice.

To meet surging demand, clinics are opening up rapidly across China.

But there's a shortage of qualified practitioners and large numbers of clinics are operating without a licence.

According to a report by iResearch, a marketing research firm, as of 2019, 80,000 venues in China were providing cosmetic procedures without a licence and 100,000 cosmetic practitioners were working without the right qualifications.

As a result, it's estimated that hundreds of accidents are happening every day inside Chinese cosmetic surgery clinics.

Dr Yang Lu, a plastic surgeon and owner of a licensed cosmetic surgery clinic in Shanghai, says in recent years the number of people coming for surgeries to repair botched operations has been growing.

""I've seen many patients whose first surgery was botched because they went to unlicensed places,"" Dr Yang says.

""Some even had surgery inside people's homes.""

Yue Yue, 28, is among those to have had surgery that went badly wrong.

In 2020 she received baby face collagen injections - designed to make the face appear more plump - from an unlicensed clinic opened by a close friend. But the fillers hardened.

""My skin felt like there was cement underneath,"" she says.

Desperate to undo the damage, Yue Yue turned to clinics she found through social media - well-known names - but the repairs only made things worse.

One clinic attempted to extract the filler using syringes. Instead of removing the hardened material, they extracted her own tissue, leaving her skin loose.

Another clinic tried lifting the skin near her ears to reach the filler underneath, leaving her with two long scars and a face that looked unnaturally tight.

""My entire image collapsed. I lost my shine and it's affected my work [in human resources for a foreign company in Shanghai] too.""

She found Dr Yang through SoYoung last year and has since undergone three repair surgeries, including for her eyelids which were damaged during a previous operation by another clinic.

But while Dr Yang's surgeries have brought visible improvements, some of the damage from the botched procedures may be permanent.

""I don't want to become prettier any more,"" she says.

""If I could go back to how I looked before surgery, I'd be quite happy.""

Every year, tens of thousands like Yue Yue fall victim to unlicensed cosmetic clinics in China.

But even some licensed clinics and qualified surgeons aren't following the rules strictly.

In 2020, actress Gao Liu's botched nose operation - in which the tip of her nose turned black and died - went viral.

""My face was disfigured and I was very down. It ruined my acting career.""

She had received the nose surgery at a licensed Guangzhou clinic called She's Times from Dr He Ming, who was described as its ""chief surgeon"" and a nose surgery expert.

But in reality Dr He was not fully qualified to perform the surgery without supervision and had not obtained his licensed plastic surgeon status from the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission.

Authorities fined the clinic, which closed soon after the scandal, and barred Dr He from practising for six months.

However, weeks before She's Times was officially dissolved, a new clinic, Qingya, requested to register at the same address.



BBC Eye has found strong links between She's Times and Qingya, such as the same Weibo account and the retention of several staff, including Dr He.

The BBC has also learned that Dr He only obtained the licensed plastic surgeon qualification in April 2024, even though he was technically barred from applying for the status for five years from the date he was sanctioned in 2021.

Qingya now claims to have opened 30 branches.

Dr He, Qingya and Guangdong Provincial Health Commission did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment.

The Chinese Embassy in the UK said: ""The Chinese government consistently requires enterprises to operate in strict compliance with national laws, regulations, and relevant policy provisions.""

Four years and two repair operations later, Gao Liu's nose remains uneven.

""I really regret it. Why did I do it?""

China's Central Health Commission has been trying to crack down on the issue of under-qualified health practitioners performing tasks beyond their expertise in recent years - including ordering local health bodies to improve regulation and issuing stricter guidelines - but problems persist.

In today's China, looking good is important for professional success.

A quick search on popular job recruitment platforms reveals many examples of employers listing physical requirements for roles, even when they have little to do with the actual work.

One receptionist role asks for candidates to be ""at least 160cm tall and aesthetically pleasing"", while an administrative job demands ""an appealing look and an elegant presence"".

And now that pressure is being exploited by a growing scam in some Chinese clinics in which vulnerable young women are offered jobs, but only if they pay for expensive surgeries carried out by their would-be employers.

Da Lan, not her real name, applied for a ""beauty consultant"" job at a clinic in Chengdu, south-western China, on a popular recruitment website in March 2024.

After the interview, she was offered the position that same evening.

But she says when she began her role the next morning, she was taken to a small room by her manager, who scanned her up and down and gave her an ultimatum - get cosmetic work done or lose out on the job.

Da Lan says she was given less than an hour to decide.

Under pressure, she agreed to undergo double eyelid surgery - priced at over 13,000 yuan (£1,330) - more than three times the monthly salary of the role - with more than 30% annual interest.

She says staff took her phone and used it to apply for a so-called ""beauty loan,"" falsifying her income details. Within a minute, the loan was approved.

By noon, she was undergoing medical tests. An hour later, she was on the operating table.

From job offer to debt and surgery - all within 24 hours.

You can watch the documentary on BBC Two at 23:00 BST on Wednesday 23 April.

Outside of the UK,you can watch the documentary on YouTube.

The surgery did nothing for her job prospects. Da Lan says her manager belittled her, shouting her name in public and swearing at her.

She quit after just a few weeks. Looking back, she believes the job was never real.

""They wanted me to leave from the beginning,"" she says.

Despite having worked there for more than 10 days, she was paid only 303 yuan ($42). With help from her friends, Da Lan paid off the debt for her surgery after six months.

BBC Eye spoke to dozens of victims, and met three including Da Lan in Chengdu, a city that has set out to become China's ""capital of cosmetic surgery"". Some have been trapped in much larger debt for years.

The clinic Da Lan says scammed her had previously been reported by other graduates and exposed by local media, but it remains open and is still recruiting for the same role.

This scam isn't limited to clinic jobs - it's creeping into other industries.

Some live-streaming companies pressure young women to take out loans for surgery, promising a shot at influencer fame.

But behind the scenes, these firms often have undisclosed agreements with clinics - taking a cut from every applicant they send to the operating table.

In a bohemian-style café in Beijing, the perfect setting for a selfie, Abby meets her friends for coffee.

The trio adjust their poses and edit their faces in great detail - extending eyelashes and reshaping their cheekbones.

When asked what they like most about their facial features, they hesitate, struggling to name a single part they wouldn't consider altering.

The conversation turns to chin implants, upper-lip shortening, and nose surgery.

Abby says she's thinking about another nose job - her current one is six years old - but surgeons are finding it difficult to operate.

""My skin isn't as stretchable after so many procedures. The doctors don't have much to work with. You can't give them enough fabric for a vest and expect a wedding dress.""

The metaphor lingers in the air, underscoring the toll taken by all of the operations.

But despite everything, Abby has no plans to stop.

Odd Indian laws: Why not walking your dog could land you in jail,"A total of 370 out of 882 Indian laws criminalise 7,305 acts - from missed dog walks to murder.",Asia,"Asia, Crime, India, Capital punishment, Law and order",Soutik Biswas,2025-04-22T22:12:05.158Z,2025-04-22T22:12:05.158Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2f1a/live/b83c1310-1f68-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2f1a/live/b83c1310-1f68-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0z7lde14eo,"In India, you can face criminal charges for tethering an animal on the street, flying a kite in a manner that causes alarm,skipping a school attendance order or handing a feeding bottle to a mother who can't breastfeed.

Of the 882 federal laws on the books, 370 contain criminal provisions - together criminalising 7,305 acts and omissions. These range from the absurd to the serious: failing to give a month's notice before quitting your job or not walking your dog enough, to offences like illegal arms possession, murder and sexual assault.

Delhi-based think-tank Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy calls it ""India's crisis of over-criminalisation"".

In a new report, The State of the System: Understanding the Scale of Crime and Punishment in India, the think-tank has produced the country's first comprehensive database of crimes, mapping the extent of criminalisation across 370 federal laws.

The report flags India's habit of reaching for criminal law to solve just about everything - even the mundane. It notes that many laws criminalise ""routine, everyday actions"".

You could, for instance, be charged for tethering your goat on a public street, fixing a leaky tap without a licence or not naming the owner of a building when asked.

Then there are the truly obscure offences - like a parent ignoring a school attendance order, applying for a driver's licence when banned or littering in a zoo. Basically, there's a criminal penalty waiting around every corner of daily life.

Let your pigs wander on to a field or road and you could be fined 10 rupees (12 cents). Disturb an animal or litter in a zoo? Six months in jail or a 2,000-rupee fine. And failing to exercise your dog can cost you up to 100 rupees and three months in jail.

Promotinginfant milk substitutesor feeding bottles to pregnant women or mothers can lead to up to three years in jail or a 5,000-rupee fine. (This was meant to curb aggressive marketing by formula food companies, but the law also applies to individuals, which makes it controversial.)

Jail is the go-to punishment in India - 73% of crimes carry prison terms ranging from a single day to 20 years.

More than 250 offences across 117 laws penalise delays in filing documents - everything from wealth and property tax returns to gift declarations, the report finds.

Some 124 crimes across 80 laws criminalise obstructing a public officer, often without clearly defining what causes ""obstruction"".

Even the death penalty isn't off the table - not just for murder or mutiny, but for damaging an oil or gas pipeline or a sentry caught sleeping on duty. In all, a staggering 301 offences in India can legally cost you your life.

Out of 7,305 offences under central laws, nearly 80% come with fines - from as low as two rupees to a staggering 50m rupees.

To be fair, many of these provisions are rarely used - India's crime records bureau tracks around 50 laws, even though 370 carry criminal penalties.

""They're not heavily enforced, but they create ample opportunities for rent-seeking,"" Naveed Mehmood Ahmad, co-author of the study at Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, told me.

""There's enough in the books to jail almost anyone for some technical non-compliance. It's less about actual use and more about the potential for misuse.""

This ""excessive use of criminal law not only disrupts the daily lives of ordinary citizens but also creates significant barriers for business operations"", the report says.

Businesses in India face a maze of regulations, but using criminal law as the default for non-compliance is excessive, disproportionate and often counter-productive, experts say.

The report also talks about some glaring inconsistencies in crime and punishment.

Rioting - the use of force or violence by an unlawful assembly - is punishable with up to two years of imprisonment. Meanwhile, falsely reporting a birth or death for official records can lead to three years of imprisonment.

The irony? Violence in public gets a lighter sentence than a lie on paper.

Even more striking: crimes of vastly different severity carry the same penalty - like practicing homoeopathy without a licence, jumping a red light, or forcing someone into labour - all punishable with a one-year sentence.

The sheer number of crimes tied to everyday life and business shows how heavily the state leans on criminalisation to enforce compliance, the report says.

""This over-reliance has significant costs, not just for citizens and businesses, but also for state machinery.""

Over 34 million criminal cases are pending in India's courts, with 72% stuck for more than a year. Prisons are overcrowded, running at 131% capacity, while courts and police forces continue to grapple with chronic staff shortages

Even the law-and-order machinery is stretched. As of 1 January 2023, India had just 154 police personnel per 100,000 people - well below the sanctioned 195. Nationwide, there are 581,000 vacancies against an approved strength of 2.72 million.

""Even then, we continue to rely on this overburdened system to combat minor infractions, including those that attract nominal fines,"" the report says.

It says that criminal law should be limited to acts that threaten core societal values - like public safety, national security, life, liberty, property and social harmony.

Authorities say they plan toscrap criminal penalties in more than 100 legal provisions- on top of the 180 already axed in 2023. It's not just legal clean-up; it's a chance to rethink how the law treats people. Less fear, more trust. Less suspect, more citizen.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0z7lde14eo
"We're orphans now, say Gaza Catholics the Pope called daily",Pope Francis had a close relationship with Gaza's tiny Christian community and used his last address to call for a ceasefire.,Middle East,"Pope Francis, Gaza",Yolande Knell,2025-04-22T16:57:14.870Z,2025-04-22T16:57:14.870Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2040/live/85102310-1f99-11f0-afee-89ab52a5298c.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2040/live/85102310-1f99-11f0-afee-89ab52a5298c.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyqgy6m8e6o,"""As-salaam Alaikum"" or ""peace be upon you,"" Pope Francis ventured in Arabic while talking to parishioners in Gaza earlier this year.

A short video released by the Vatican upon his death showed his intimate relationship with the Palestinian territory's tiny Christian community, many of whom he came to know by name.

During 18-months of war, he took to calling them nightly to check on their wellbeing.

""What did you eat today?"" the Pope asks the local priests in the video, having switched to Italian. ""The rest of the chicken from yesterday,"" replies Father Gabriel Romanelli.

Only a few hundred Christians remain in Gaza among the territory's almost entirely Muslim population of more than 2 million. Many have been living, as well as worshipping, at the Holy Family Catholic Church in Gaza City.

With the Pope's death they feel they have lost a dear friend.

""He used to call us daily during the war, on the black days under the bombing - on the days when people were killed and injured,"" Father Romanelli said.

""Sometimes, we didn't have a phone connection for hours and the Pope with all of his responsibilities would try to reach us.""

George Anton, a local Catholic, is the emergency coordinator in the Holy Family church. He told me that shock left him virtually speechless the first time he spoke to the Pope but that he ended up talking to him regularly on video calls.

He explained to the pontiff how he had lost his home and relatives.

""He was all the time blessing me and he was totally understanding our situation and he always encouraged us to be strong,"" Mr Anton said.  ""And he asked 'What can I do for you? What more can I do for you'?""

The Gazan Christians say they will now miss a great source of comfort and support.

""We felt like 'Oh my God, we're like orphans now',"" Mr Anton said.

""There will be no calls from the Pope, we will not hear this voice.  We will not hear his sense of humour. You know Pope Francis has a special relation with Gaza, and with every one of us.""

Pope Francis visited the Holy Land in 2014. A defining image of his trip came at an unscheduled stop off in Bethlehem when he prayed for peace by the graffitied wall that forms part of Israel's West Bank barrier.

On Sunday in his Easter message, his last public appearance, he was again calling for peace and a ceasefire in Gaza.

With his words read by an aide, he said: ""The terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation.''

""War is not just weapons.  War is sometimes words,"" the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, said when I asked him about the Pope's final address.  He said the Pope had a moral clarity.

""Pope Francis recently, especially in the last year, has been very outspoken about the situation of the Holy Land, calling for the liberation of the hostages, but also condemning the dramatic situation, the ongoing war in Gaza and the situation for Palestinians,"" the cardinal said.

Israeli media has noted that while President Isaac Herzog expressed condolences to the Catholic world, there were not similar comments from the prime minister or foreign minister as would have been expected - widely attributed to the Pope's strong positions against the Gaza war.

Some of his most explicit criticism of Israel came late last year when excerpts of an upcoming book were published.

""According to some experts, what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,"" Pope Francis wrote.

""It should be carefully investigated to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.""

Israel firmly rejects allegations of genocide in Gaza and says its war goal is to defeat Hamas.

Why did Pope Francis never return to Argentina during his papacy?,Pope Francis was a source of pride for Argentina - but his failure to visit was a disappointment for many. ,World,"Catholicism, Argentina, Vatican City, Pope Francis, Roman Catholic Church",Veronica Smink,2025-04-22T10:49:37.456Z,2025-04-22T10:49:37.456Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e150/live/3af291f0-1f6c-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e150/live/3af291f0-1f6c-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdzy96xdzqo,"When the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Jorge Mario Bergoglio, left Argentina's capital to participate in the Vatican conclave to elect Pope Benedict XVI's successor, he did not know it would be the last time he would see his hometown.

The fact that Pope Francis never returned to his country after becoming the pontiff left some Argentines with a heavy heart.

Speaking on Monday, Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge Ignacio García Cuerva said his parish were ""orphans of a father who profoundly loved his country and had to learn to become the father of the whole world"".

He also added that Francis becoming Pope ""cost us as Argentines a little bit... Bergoglio left us to become Francis"".



It came as a surprise to many – including Bergoglio himself – that he was elected to the highest office in the Catholic Church in the first place.

At 76 years old at the time - one year older than the typical age of bishops and cardinals when they submit their resignation to the pope - he was not seen as a real candidate to fill the vacancy, according to analysts.

""When he left Buenos Aires for the conclave, he seemed somewhat sad; he was getting ready to retire in a room at the Priests' Home in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Flores,"" Guillermo Marcó, a priest from the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, told Argentine newspaper Clarín.

However, Bergoglio would soon begin a papacy that lasted 12 years.

His death has been particularly keenly felt in his home country, where seven days of national mourning have been declared - as Argentina grieves a man many regarded as simple and humble, despite holding one of the most powerful offices in the world.

Those qualities were praised by Elenir Ramazol, a nun who spoke to BBC Mundo  during a vigil at the Buenos Aires cathedral on Monday.

The fact he did not return to his homeland was ""a sign of the total commitment he made to the whole Church, not just to his people, to his country"", Ms Ramazol said.

Gustavo Vera exchanged hundreds of letters with Francis, having become friends with him when he was still archbishop. He agreed that the pontiff always showed an enduring interest in what was happening in his home country.

""Sometimes he commented on soccer, sometimes on tango, sometimes on cultural events,"" Mr Vera, the leader of La Alameda, an Argentine anti-trafficking and slavery organisation, said. Francis followed Argentine news ""in detail"", he added.

During his papacy, Francis visited four of the five countries that border Argentina - but never his home country, despite continuing to take a keen interest in it.

He was loved by many there who now mourn him, but others remember him as a controversial figure.

The initial pride felt by most Argentines after the announcement that a fellow countryman would be the first Latin American pope gave way to disenchantment among some over the years.

A Pew Research Center survey suggested that the proportion of people who held a positive view of the pontiff fell from 91% in 2013 to 64% in 2024.

Of six Latin American countries surveyed, the largest drop in favourable attitudes was recorded in Argentina.

Conservatives in Argentina accused him of undermining historical traditions they held sacred, while reformers hoped for more profound changes.

Critics felt he failed to do enough to oppose the country's brutal military dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s and to criticise the complicity of some figures in the Church.

Every time he was asked about a possible trip, Pope Francis gave vague answers.

""I would like to go. It's my people, but it hasn't been planned yet. There are several things to sort out first,"" he said the last time he was publicly asked about the subject, in September 2024.

Some fellow Argentines found this hesitation difficult to understand.

The pontiff's absence has been felt more acutely in recent years, as Argentina has endured a profound economic crisis, with annual inflation reaching nearly 300% and a sharp increase in poverty.

Mr Vera suggests that Francis was planning to visit, but had not yet done so because he wanted to avoid his presence being used for political purposes.

""He always used to say he would go to Argentina when he felt that he was an instrument to bring about national unity, to help overcome the rift, to try to bring Argentines back together,"" Mr Vera said.

The ""rift"" refers to the vast, decades-long gulf in Argentine politics and society between supporters and opponents of the populist political movement Peronism, founded by late President Juan Perón in the 1940s.

There is a widespread belief in the country that Pope Francis was a Peronist - something he denied in a book in 2023, while adding: ""If we had a Peronist conception of politics, what would be wrong with that?""

The comment was seized upon by conservative detractors who accused him of being too closely aligned with social justice causes and left-wing politics.

Before taking office, Javier Milei, the current president who has demonised left-wing politics, even called Pope Francis ""the representation of evil on Earth"" - although he softened his tone after coming to power.

The two had a cordial meeting in the Vatican and President Milei officially invited the pontiff to Argentina. And following the Pope's death, Milei said he was deeply pained by his loss, and praised the pontiff's benevolence and wisdom.

Some Argentines accused him of being too close to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a divisive left-leaning populist politician, who was president from 2007 to 2015.

But according to Mr Vera, the Pope met with people ""from the whole political and social spectrum of Argentina"".

The late pontiff's friend also pointed out that, while there was some criticism of Pope Francis in the media and major urban centres, he was loved in other parts of the country.

Although he maintained his connection with Argentina, Mr Vera said, Pope Francis no longer felt he belonged to just one country.

""Argentines believe he was Argentinian, but in reality, he was a citizen of the world,"" he added.

It is a view shared by Alejandra Castro, a social worker who was among the mourners who gathered on Monday night at Buenos Aires cathedral.

Argentina was ""always in his prayers"", Ms Castro said. ""In one way or another, he was always present, and I think that shows that in his heart, Argentina was always present.""

But Mr Vera acknowledged that not everyone felt the same way, and suggested it was up to Argentines to look within themselves for answers: ""Rather than blaming Francis, we Argentines should ask ourselves what we were doing that meant we did not deserve the Pope's visit.""

Who will be the next Pope? The top candidates in an unpredictable process,Several names are prominent as cardinals prepare to gather in the Vatican to elect Pope Francis' successor. ,Europe,"Catholicism, Vatican City, Roman Catholic Church, Religion, Italy","Aleem Maqbool, Rebecca Seales & Paul Kirby",2025-04-22T13:48:18.018Z,2025-04-23T15:39:59.255Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6068/live/e2486fe0-1f78-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6068/live/e2486fe0-1f78-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxk40ndk1o,"Who will be the next pope? The decision could have a profound impact on the Catholic Church and the world's 1.4 billion baptised Roman Catholics.

It also promises to be a highly unpredictable and open process for a host of reasons.

The College of Cardinals will meet in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to debate and then vote for their preferred candidates until a single name prevails.

With 80% of the cardinals appointed by Pope Francis himself, they are not only electing a pope for the first time, but will offer a broad global perspective.

For the first time in history, fewer than half of those given a vote will be European.

And although the college may be dominated by his appointments, they were not exclusively ""progressive"" or ""traditionalist"".

For those reasons, it is harder than ever to predict who will be elected the next pope.

Could the cardinals elect an African or an Asian pope, or might they favour one of the old hands of the Vatican administration?

Here are some of the names being mentioned as Francis's potential successor.

Nationality: Italian

Age: 70

Softly spoken Italian Cardinal Parolin was the Vatican's secretary of state under Pope Francis – making him the pope's chief adviser. The secretary of state also heads the Roman Curia, the Church's central administration.

Having acted effectively as deputy pope, he could be considered a frontrunner.

He is viewed by some as more likely to prioritise diplomacy and a global outlook than the purity of Catholic dogma. His critics consider that a problem, while his supporters see a strength.

But he has been critical of the legalisation of same-sex marriage around the world,  calling a landmark 2015 vote in favourin the Republic of Ireland ""a defeat for humanity"".

The bookmakers may back him but Cardinal Parolin will be well aware of an old Italian saying that stresses the uncertainty of the pope-picking process: ""He who enters a conclave as a pope, leaves it as a cardinal.""

Some 213 of the previous 266 popes have been Italian and even though there has not been an Italian pope in 40 years, the pivot of the upper echelons of the Church away from Italy and Europe may mean there may not be another for now.

Nationality: Filipino

Age: 67

Could the next pope come from Asia?

Cardinal Tagle has decades of pastoral experience – meaning he has been an active Church leader among the people as opposed to a diplomat for the Vatican or cloistered expert on Church law.

The Church is massively influential in the Philippines, where about 80% of the population is Catholic. The country currently has a record five members of the College of Cardinals – which could make for a significant lobbying faction if they all back Cardinal Tagle.

He is considered a moderate within the Catholic definition, and has been dubbed the ""Asian Francis"" because of a dedication to social issues and sympathy for migrants that he shared with the late pope.

He has opposed abortion rights, calling them ""a form of murder"" – a position in line with the Church's broader stance that life begins at conception. He has also spoken against euthanasia.

But in 2015 when he was Archbishop of Manila, Cardinal Tagle called for the Church to reassess its ""severe"" stance towards gay people, divorcees and single mothers, saying past harshness had done lasting harm and left people feeling ""branded"", and that each individual deserved compassion and respect.

The cardinal was considered a candidate to be pope as far back as the 2013 conclave in which Francis was elected.

Asked a decade ago how he viewed suggestions he could be next, he replied: ""I treat it like a joke! It's funny.""

Nationality: Congolese

Age: 65

It's very possible the next pope could be from Africa, where the Catholic Church continues to add millions of members. Cardinal Ambongo is a leading candidate, hailing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

He has been Archbishop of Kinshasa for seven years, and was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis.

He is a cultural conservative, opposing blessings for same-sex marriage, stating that ""unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil"".

Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.

But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: ""Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.""

Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.

Nationality: Ghanaian

Age: 76

If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.

Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. ""I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,"" he told the BBC in 2013.

Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because ""those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters"".

He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.

Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.

A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.

Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.

In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.

In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.

Nationality: Hungarian

Age: 72

A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.

He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.

The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.

Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.

His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the ""illiberal democracy"" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.

Nationality: Italian

Age: 83

Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.

The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.

His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said ""death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something"".

Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.

Nationality: German

Age: 71

Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.

The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.

He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.

But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.

Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.

Nationality: Canadian

Age: 80

Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.

For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.

As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.

Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.

He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that ""Christ is male, the Church is feminine"".

Nationality: American

Age: 69

Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?

Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.

Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.

He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.

Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.

He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.

Nationality: Guinean

Age: 79

Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.

The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.

He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.

While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.

Nationality: Italian

Age: 60

Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.

Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as ""the heart of the life of this world"".

Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.

However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.

Nationality: Canadian

Age: 78

Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.

Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.

He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.

Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.

Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxk40ndk1o
"Who is Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the acting head of the Vatican? ",The cardinal will oversee the Vatican until a new pontiff is elected. ,N/A,Pope Francis,Madeline Halpert,2025-04-21T23:51:19.166Z,2025-04-21T23:51:19.166Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0af6/live/e5f04d30-1eff-11f0-8558-edc4b2484636.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0af6/live/e5f04d30-1eff-11f0-8558-edc4b2484636.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly1md6r3l8o,"When the world learned of Pope Francis' death on Monday morning, an Irish-American cardinal, little known in the wider world, was the one to break the news.

After announcing that the pope had ""returned to the home of the Father"", Irish-American Cardinal Kevin Farrell took on one of his biggest roles yet: the ""camerlengo"", or the person who runs the Vatican after the death or resignation of a pope.

Pope Francis nominated the cardinal for the role in 2019. The cardinal will remain in the position during the ""Apostolica Sedes Vacans"", the period between the death or resignation of a pope until the election of the next pontiff.

He also will play an important role in the centuries-old ceremonies to mourn Pope Francis.

Born in 1947 in Dublin, Farrell attended the University of Salamanca in Spain and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, according to the Vatican.

He held roles in churches around the world, serving as a chaplain at the University of Monterrey in Mexico as well as at a parish in Bethesda, Maryland.

All told, the 77-year-old spent more than 30 years working for churches in the US.

Farrell was appointed Bishop of Dallas in 2007 until Pope Francis asked him in 2016 to serve as the leader of the Vatican's new department responsible for the pastoral care of families, raising him to the rank of cardinal.

Years after naming him as camerlengo, in 2023, Francis chose Farrell as president of the Supreme Court of Vatican City State. He was also named president of the Commission for Confidential Matters.

As camerlengo, Cardinal Farrell will be tasked with making arrangements for the conclave, the process through which the next pontiff is selected.

Technically, a camerlengo can become pope, as has happened twice in history: Gioacchino Pecci (Pope Leo XIII) in 1878 and Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) in 1939.

The cardinal also will preside over the certification of Francis's death, laying his body into the coffin. After that, the cardinal is expected to lead a procession moving the pope's body from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta to St Peter's Basilica.

The ceremony could take place as soon as Wednesday morning, according to the Vatican.

Canada election: Top candidates talk fossil fuels as climate agenda slips ,"Amid tariff threats from the US, energy and economic security are key issues in Canada's federal election. ",US & Canada,"Climate, Canada election 2025, Mark Carney, Canada",Matt McGrath,2025-04-21T23:16:49.029Z,2025-04-21T23:16:49.029Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2c78/live/eb1a46b0-1aa1-11f0-999d-89a1b86ed8d9.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2c78/live/eb1a46b0-1aa1-11f0-999d-89a1b86ed8d9.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87pev3jpyyo,"As the threat posed by US President Donald Trump tops Canada's federal election agenda, the issue of the country's contribution to global warming has been largely overshadowed.

The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.

Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.

It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.

In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.

That sense of unity is now long gone.

Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.

As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.

However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.

The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.

It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as ""Carbon Tax Carney"".

Some observers believe that cancelling the tax was a smart political move, others feel it was a mistake.

""By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,"" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.

""I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.""

Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into ""a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy"".

He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.

There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.

Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.

The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.

""We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,"" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.

""And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.""

Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.

He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers ""woke"" cultural issues.

Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.

While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace ""dirty coal"" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.

According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.

He told the BBC it's more ""at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable"".

Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.

That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.

Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.

""Our relationship with the US has completely changed,"" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.

""The pipelines are a national security problem for us.""

That concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets.

A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles.

In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track ""energy corridors"",  though Carneyhas flip-flopped on his support for pipelines,knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.

He is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn;  £4.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023.

And while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments.

Yves-François Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Québécois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a ""denial situation about climate change"".

""I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales"" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates.

Canada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005.

As of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%.

Whoever wins the election will have a real challenge to square that circle.

Bereaved parents demand social media firms 'protect children',Four families who believe social media had a role in the death of their children are protesting in New York. ,Technology,"Social media, TikTok",Jon Kay,2025-04-24T12:07:07.899Z,2025-04-24T14:24:48.255Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/98b4/live/fe449d90-2108-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/98b4/live/fe449d90-2108-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn3gnee77o,"A group of British parents who believe social media played a part in the death of their children have travelled to the US to demand better online safety protections for children.

Four families flew to New York City to protest with hundreds of others from the US and Canadaoutside the offices of Meta - owner of Facebook and Instagram.

""All we're asking for is can you please help us protect our children,"" said Mark Kenevan, father of Isaac who died aged 13 from taking part in a social media challenge.

Their visit comes as media regulator Ofcom announced that websites will belegally required to block children's access to harmful contentfrom July to continue operating in the UK.

Websites will also have to introduce more rigorous age checks, according to its final children's code of practice published on Thursday.

BBC Breakfast followed the four British families on their mission in the US.

The British parents walked with American families through the streets of New York City. Some parents held signs saying ""Meta profits, kids pay the price"".

Others clutched framed treasured photos of their children, who had died.

Lisa Kenevan, mother of Isaac, said the families banding together had given each other strength.

""We just want government, we want tech companies to understand that we are getting stronger, our voices are getting stronger, and we're not going to go away,"" she said.

A coroner ruled that Isaac had died in 2022 as a result of misadventure, but the Kenevans say social media platforms were also to blame.

This year they were among several families who filed awrongful death lawsuit against TikTokin the US, which accuses the platform of pushing dangerous prank and challenge videos to children to boost engagement time.

Maia Walsh's family, who are part of the lawsuit, also believe the 13-year-old died from injuries while taking part in an online challenge. Aninquest into her death will examine her use of TikTok.

Her father Liam Walsh, talking about the New York protest, told BBC Breakfast: ""I feel as though we're getting recognition for what happened to our children, because there is something in it - it's not just desperate parents clutching at straws.

""We're slowly revealing what happened to our children, and this is part of that movement.""

TikTok says it prohibits dangerous content or challenges on the platform, and directs those who search for hashtags or videos to its safety centre.

Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, says it also shares the goal of keeping teens safe online and had recently introduced ""teen accounts"" with enhanced protections.

""We believe teens deserve consistent protections across all the different apps they use - not just our platforms,"" Meta said in a statement.

Also among the parents in New York is Ellen Roome, who believes her 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died after an online challenge went wrong in 2022 and his social media accounts could provide the evidence needed. An inquest into his death found he took his own life.

""[He was] just a normal, lovely boy. Not one moment in our life did we think we would be in this position... there was nothing that gave us any indication that there was a problem,"" Ms Roome said, who is campaigning for legislation to grant parents access to their children's social media accounts if they die.

""I almost want to tell parents 'you don't know what your children are looking at'.

""This isn't for our children because it's too late, but for them to have that conversation with their children about what are they looking at, what are they seeing.""

The BBC previously approached TikTok, X, Snapchat, Discord and Meta - which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads - to ask about Ms Roome's case.

None of them gave a formal response, but a spokesperson from Snapchat previously said: ""Our hearts go out to Ms Roome and her family for the loss of Jools.

""We have extra protections for under 18s and offer parental tools so parents can see who their teens are communicating with and report any concerns.""

A spokesperson for TikTok has also previously said the company had removed 99% of videos showing or promoting dangerous content before it was reported by a user.

Also among the parents in New York was Lorin LaFave, mother of 14-year-oldBreck Bednar who was lured to his deathin 2014 after being groomed online whilst gaming.

The online safety campaigner, who now shares Breck's story in schools through the Breck Foundation, said: ""I would love to see age restrictions. For me I think children need their childhood longer.

""They're being exposed to so much adult content and adult relationships too soon, too young, and you're only a child once.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn3gnee77o

She also said that her four other children had been ""stolen by the state"", and described her family, which she did not want to be part of, as ""bigoted"".

Marten, 37, and Mark Gordon, 50, deny gross negligence manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child.

They are facing a retrial at the Old Bailey. Marten had been due to start giving evidence on Tuesday but complained of a toothache and headache.

In their first trial, they were found guilty of concealing the birth of a child and perverting the course of justice by not reporting the death of their baby.

The couple's baby Victoria, their fifth child, was found dead in a shed on a Brighton allotment, in a shopping bag covered in rubbish in March 2023. Her body was so badly decomposed that pathologists could not ascertain the cause of death.

Their four other children had previously been taken into care.

Giving evidence for the first time on Thursday, Marten was asked by her barrister Mr FitzGibbon KC if she loved her daughter.

""Absolutely"", Marten replied.

""Did you do anything to cause her harm?"", Mr FitzGibbon KC asked.

""Absolutely not. We did everything we could to protect her"", Marten said.

She was then asked how she felt now about her daughter's death.

Marten said: ""I don't think this process has really allowed me to grieve properly. I still feel angry, upset. Still an element of shock"".

Asked about the couple's four other children Marten said she ""loved them extremely.""

""Not being with them is very, very hard"".

When Mr FitzGibbon KC asked if she agreed with the decisions made about taking the children away, Marten said ""absolutely not… it's an absolute outrage"", adding that her children were ""stolen by the state"".

Marten told the jury that since she was little she always wanted to have a big family, adding ""at least seven children would be my dream"". She said she would have liked to live on a farm.

She said she met Mark Gordon about 10 years ago in a shop in East London. ""I sort of see it as fate,"" she said.

Asked how she feels about him, she said: ""I love him very much"", adding that he was ""very dear"" to her.

When asked about whether she would describe her background as privileged, Marten said ""financially yes, emotionally not all"".

She said she tried to introduce Gordon to members of her family, but she found them to be ""very cold"" towards him.

""I have always had a frosty relationship with my family.

""They can be quite bigoted. I don't really want to be part of it"", she said.

""I didn't really grow up with them,"" she said. ""I went to boarding school when I was about eight.""

She said that when she got pregnant with Victoria, she and Gordon had at first planned to move abroad but her family intervened.

As a result, they left their home in London and lived in a series of hotels and bed and breakfasts, she explained, adding that in the week before Christmas 2022, they rented a cottage in Northumberland.

On Christmas Eve they went shopping for baby equipment at Primark in Carlisle where she started feeling that the baby was coming.

""I started having birth pangs pretty much as we started leaving Carlisle,"" she said.

She drove back to the cottage and said she gave birth leaning against the bed upstairs without medical assistance. ""It was a very quick birth actually, Very easy,"" she said.

Two days later the family moved on again.

""Obviously it would have been nicer to have been somewhere stable and to have been able to properly relax… but we weren't in that position"", she told the jury.

Earlier in the trial Gordon declined to give evidence in his defence.

Opening the defence for his client John Femi-Ola KC said: ""I do not propose to call Mr Gordon.""

More sunshine and a change in the wind direction are expected to bring the warmest weather of the year so far.

It might even be time to dust off the BBQ and apply the sunscreen.

Saturday sees temperatures range from 13-17C with the possibility of western areas seeing some rain. Eastern parts of the UK are likely to stay dry but there will be a good deal of cloud.

On Sunday the next band of rain will be pushed back to Scotland and Northern Ireland. In England and Wales, as pressure starts to rise, the cloud will break to leave sunnier skies and it will start to warm up.

The two largest marathons in the UK both take place on Sunday and many runners will be hoping the warmer weather starts a day later.

TheLondonmarathon will be dry and mostly sunny with light winds. At the start of the race, temperatures will be 13C but for runners finishing around mid-afternoon it will be a warm 20 or 21C.

For the marathon inManchesterthere will be spells of sunshine and it should stay dry. A gentle south-westerly breeze is expected with the temperature peaking at 17C in the afternoon.

From early next week the temperatures continue to climb as the wind changes direction to a south-easterly and we tap into some warmer air from the near continent.

Temperatures will climb widely to 22-23C and it will feel very pleasant in the sunshine. In the Midlands and south-east England temperatures are forecast to reach 25-27C by Wednesday.

This will be the warmest weather of the year so far and the warmest since early September.

It is not unusual to have these temperatures at this time of the year. The highest April temperature ever recorded is 29.4C which was reached in London on 16 April 1949. However, the last time the temperature rose to 27C in April was in 2018 in Cambridge.

Ablocked weather patternwith high pressure to the east of the UK and low pressure to the west means the heat will be drawn up from continental Europe.

This pattern could remain in place until the end of next week at least.

The position of the areas of high and low pressure may alter by next weekend, allowing cooler air to reach northern parts of the UK and showers may affect southern areas. This is still some way off and may change.

You can find out how warm it will be where you are on the BBC Weather app or by catching up with the latestWeather for the Week Ahead.

The jet stream that affects the UK is powered by temperature contrasts between the Arctic and the Tropics. As climate change continues to rapidly warm Arctic regions, it is possible that the jet stream will become weaker and distort more often leading to more of these 'blocked' patterns.",https://www.bbc.com/weather/articles/c89g5wd3pzeo
"New sex-based rights guidance on way, says Swinney","First minister promised ""timely"" guidance covering the issue of single-sex spaces following a Supreme Court ruling.",Scotland Politics,"Scottish government, Scotland, John Swinney, Women's rights, UK Supreme Court, Transgender people",BBC News,2025-04-24T13:19:58.085Z,2025-04-24T13:19:58.085Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/357a/live/e0832d30-210d-11f0-83a1-1998ef896e82.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/357a/live/e0832d30-210d-11f0-83a1-1998ef896e82.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kxr4y3mv8o,"The Scottish government will issue ""timely guidance"" on the issue of single-sex spaces following the Supreme Court gender ruling, John Swinney has said.

The first minister said new sex-based rights guidance is being developed after theSupreme Court ruled that biological sex defines a womanfor the purposes of the Equality Act.

But a meeting between Scottish ministers and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission to discuss drawing up new guidance has been postponed.

Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay urged the first minister to ""end the era of divisive gender politics"" in the wake of the landmark court ruling.

The UK's highest court last week ruled the definition of a woman in the 2010 Equality Act is based on biology in a move that will have major implications for single-sex spaces and services such as public toilets and changing rooms.

It means means transgender women with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) can be excluded from single-sex spaces for women if ""proportionate"".

At First Minister's Questions, Swinney was pressed on what the Scottish government is doing about last week's ruling - it had previously argued in court that transgender people with a GRC are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.

The first minister said: ""We are considering the details of the Supreme Court judgment, taking the necessary advice from the Equalities and Human Rights Commission about the application of that advice, and that will have a bearing on the judgments that are made in relation to public services and I would expect... all public bodies to operate on that basis and within the law.""

A meeting between Scottish ministers and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission - the body tasked with providing guidance on how equalities law in enacted in practice - scheduled for later has been postponed.

This is because the commission does not want to meet Scottish ministers before they have met UK government ministers.

Protests were held at the weekend by pro-trans campaigners, with Swinney saying he understood why the trans community would feel ""uncertain and anxious"" over the court ruling.

Reflecting on the ruling, Russell Findlay said: ""Common sense and a basic respect for biological truth, have now prevailed thanks to the incredible Scottish women who would not wheesht.

""Will John Swinney finally apologise to the women of Scotland?""

Swinney replied: ""The Scottish government accepts the judgement of the Supreme Court.""

Later in the exchanges, former Conservative leader Douglas Ross asked Swinney to answer a ""straightforward"" question: ""Does he believe that trans women are women?""

The first minister replied that the Scottish government ""accepts the judgement of the Supreme Court that a woman in the Equality Act 2010 is defined by biological sex"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kxr4y3mv8o

Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows police recorded 152,416 thefts from the person offences last year, the highest since the current data methods began in 2003.

Shoplifting was also on the rise, surpassing half a million recorded offences for the first time.

Meanwhile, the number of homicides was the lowest for a decade, and overall crime was still below pre-pandemic levels and down more than 75% since the mid-1990s.

There were also 54,587 knife crime offences recorded by police in 2024, up 2% from the previous year, while firearm offences decreased by 20%.

Overall, police recorded 6.64 million crimes in England and Wales last year - down 1% from 2023.

Responding to the data, policing minister Dame Diana Johnson said the government ""will not tolerate the criminality blighting our communities"".

She added: ""That's why we're putting almost 3,000 more bobbies on the beat in neighbourhood roles this year.""

To build a bigger picture of crime in England and Wales, the ONS also refers to estimates from its crime survey.

The Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) is a face-to-face survey which asks people aged 16 and over about their experiences of crime in the past year.

It estimated that there were 9.6 million incidents of what is described as ""headline crime"" in 2024 - which includes theft, robbery, criminal damage, fraud, computer misuse, and violence with or without injury.

Thelatest CSEW surveyreported that at the end of 2024:

Meanwhile, ONS data showed no significant change in people's experience of violent crime, which remained at the lowest level since equivalent records began in 1981.

The ONS reported that, over the last 10 years, there has been an increase in sexual assault.

In the year to March last year, 2.6% of people aged 16 to 59 reported experiencing sexual assault, including attempts. Ten years earlier, the proportion was 1.5%.

There has been a fall in domestic abuse over the same period, with 5.4% of those aged 16-59 reporting they had experienced domestic abuse in the previous 12 months, down from 6.5% a decade earlier.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crld4lgelp3o
Laos methanol poisoning: 'Don't let it be your best friend',Bethany Clarke wants more done to educate people about the dangers of bootleg alcohol abroad.,Newsbeat,Laos,Jack Gray,2025-04-24T13:08:28.235Z,2025-04-24T13:08:28.235Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a37a/live/5ccb41b0-20fb-11f0-b122-c52cf00da345.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a37a/live/5ccb41b0-20fb-11f0-b122-c52cf00da345.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27r2z0zveo,"The best friend of a woman who died from methanol poisoning on holiday has called on the government to do more to educate teenagers in schools about the dangers of drinking alcohol abroad.

Bethany Clarke was travelling in Laos in south-east Asia with childhood friend Simone White when they drank free shots they were offered in a hostel in November.

The following day, they both became unwell and initially thought they had food poisoning. But, a few days later, 28-year-old Simone died in hospital.

The Foreign Office and Department for Education have been contacted for a comment about Bethany's petition.

Simone, who was from Orpington in south-east London, and Bethany planned to stay in Cambodia for just under two weeks, and spend four days in Laos.

They fell ill after drinking six vodka shots served to them at the Nana Backpackers hostel in traveller hotspot Vang Vieng.

Five other tourists also died after drinking at the hostel.

Their drinks are thought to have contained methanol - a deadly substance often found in bootleg alcohol.

Medical specialists say drinking as little as 25ml of methanol can be fatal, but it is sometimes added to drinks because it is cheaper than alcohol.

But Bethany, 28, tells BBC Newsbeat they didn't even realise anything was wrong until the next day.

""This all happened on the fourth day of the trip. We did the tubing that day and that was good,"" she says.

""It's difficult to obviously describe the timeline. I think when I realised it was all going wrong was when we were on the kayaks for a trip we were doing the following morning. So just over 12 hours on.

""I guess that was when me and Simone were flat on the back of these kayaks, not being able to use our arms. We were just literally staring up into space.

""That was a moment where I thought I really don't understand what's happening to us. It just seemed like I was just having to accept my fate.""



Bethany says even when they tried to get help, it took them a while to be treated for methanol poisoning and they had to search for information about it themselves.

""The doctors kept saying it was food poisoning, which obviously didn't help with trying to treat what was going on,"" she says.

""This is when our other friends said 'let's get to a private hospital'. In the ambulance on the way there our friend mentioned to the paramedic 'could it be methanol poisoning?' He'd done a little bit of research on his phone.

""They rushed Simone off to have dialysis straight away and said to me 'look can you just sign these forms and we'll do our best to save her life?'

""And yeah, they did their best.""

Bethany says the group trusted the hostel because the reviews were good but she's now urging others to be careful.

""We didn't think we were doing anything stupid, but obviously now I do feel like I should have known more.

""The advice is from me 'steer clear, drink beer'. Look up the symptoms, be mindful about where you're drinking.

""Just don't let it be your best friend that dies from methanol poisoning.""

Bethany's also set up a petition calling for the dangers of methanol poisoning to be put on the school curriculum in the UK.

It says ""children should be taught the dangers of consuming bootleg alcohol as part of the PSHE and/or Biology curriculum in school"".

""I think it just needs to be a five minute talk or possibly even some kind of public health advert, just giving the case study of Laos and saying this can happen,"" she says.

""If people want to take the risk and drink it, at least they've been educated and then they might even be able to spot some of the symptoms if they do happen to drink it.""

Bethany is currently working in Australia and has since made a full recovery.

She says Simone was ""so full of life, energetic, sporty, musical - there's 100 adjectives I could probably come up with"".

""She was just the best friend that anybody could hope for.

""If you ever had a problem she'd always be trying to help you with it and she was just such a good listener.""

Two people were arrested on suspicion of causing serious injuries by dangerous driving following the three-car crash whichleft seven people in hospital.

Three people were airlifted to major trauma centres from the scene of the crash on the A541 near the Downing Arms Inn in Bodfari, Denbighshire, on Wednesday evening, while four others were taken by ambulance to hospitals in the area.

North Wales Police said their injuries ranged from life-threatening to life-changing.

Tony Johnson, who lives nearby, was one of the first people on the scene, and said he helped pull one driver from a burning car which was engulfed by flames ""within two minutes"".

He said: ""We were sat down to have dinner around 19:20 last night when we heard a tremendous bang. The kind of bang where you know something serious has happened.

""We came outside to the road, a couple of vehicles obviously had a big collision, one of them was on fire.""

He said he and a neighbour approached the burning car and saw the driver was still inside.

""We made the decision to get him out, because there was obviously danger with the fire... within two minutes, the whole vehicle was in a ball of flames.""

Mr Johnson said the location of the collision was on ""a nasty blind bend"" which was prone to accidents, but not ""as bad as this one"".

Scott Davidson, on whose property the accident partly happened, was out when it happened but said the scene was ""horrendous"" when he returned.

""One car was on fire and the paramedics, ambulance, police - there must have been 20 or 30 people treating the guys in the accident,"" he said.

""The car on fire was in the main road on the opposite side, one of the cars has come through our fence onto our property.""

The road was cleared and reopened on Thursday morning, but the aftermath of the collision could clearly be seen.

Debris and small parts of vehicles were visible on the same side of the road as the now-closed Downing Arms Inn.

The collision happened in a 40mph zone just before the road changes to 60mph as you leave the village.

A wooden fence of a nearby property was damaged as well as nearby trees and bushes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82wr1pdzpo
Police watchdog complains to Ofcom over BBC's Panorama on Chris Kaba ,The Chris Kaba episode initially aired without the IOPC's response to claims made by an ex-employee.,UK,"Chris Kaba shooting, Metropolitan Police Service",Paul Glynn,2025-04-24T11:58:18.293Z,2025-04-24T11:58:18.293Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8263/live/80dffa80-20e4-11f0-9b17-b99e39a28c13.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8263/live/80dffa80-20e4-11f0-9b17-b99e39a28c13.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr783gxve9go,"A police watchdog has complained to Ofcom over an episode of Panorama about the shooting of Chris Kaba.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) went to the broadcasting watchdog after its request for a public apology from the BBC went unmet, after the programme initially aired without including the IOPC's statement in response toclaims made by its own former regional director Sal Naseem.

A BBC spokeswoman said the corporation's own Executive Complaints Unit (ECU)rulinghad judged the complaint to be ""resolved"" after it had been accepted as an oversight not to include the IOPC's point of view; the iPlayer version and online article were quickly amended.

Mr Kaba was shot dead after he tried to ram his way out of a police vehicle stop in south London in September 2022.

Sgt Martyn Blake, an officer in the specialist firearms unit MO19, was found not guilty of murder in October last year, prompting protests from the Kaba family.

Speaking after the verdict at the Old Bailey, Mr Kaba's family said it was ""painful proof that our lives are not valued by the system"".

Mr Naseem told BBC Panorama that in his opinion, he had not been convinced that Mr Kaba presented a sufficient danger to justify being shot.

He suggested that the murder investigation into Mr Blake was launched amid pressure over potential unrest, which is denied by the IOPC.

The IOPC complained that the programme did not make clear that Mr Naseem no longer works for the watchdog, and that it was not given the proper right to reply to the claims over why the investigation was launched.

In the programme, Mr Naseem said that when the IOPC launched its homicide investigation four days after the shooting, ""It was fed back to us... that if we hadn't done it at that time then it's likely there would have been a level of disorder.""

The IOPC's statement denying this was added to the iPlayer version of the Panorama episode and online news stories.

The statement read: ""The decisions to criminally investigate Sergeant Blake, and then refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), followed careful consideration of a significant amount of evidence gathered during our independent investigation and by applying the relevant legal tests which govern our work.""

According to the BBC complaint unit's judgement, Panorama should have provided the IOPC with specific information about the claims to be made about it, and therefore found an element of unfairness to the IOPC.

However it noted the programme makers had taken subsequent action to include the organisation's right to reply in the iPlayer version and related online article, which was deemed ""sufficient to resolve this aspect of the complaint.""

But the IOPC said on Thursday it had complained to Ofcom because it was ""hugely dissatisfied that, despite admitting these two breaches of its own guidelines, the BBC has steadfastly refused to apologise publicly despite the IOPC providing evidence to show the serious reputational damage caused to the organisation as a result of the programme.

""In particular, the suggestion within that programme, that the IOPC was pressured to start a homicide investigation, was wrong and resulted in public criticism from a number of media organisations and individuals including concerns raised by the London Assembly and local councillors about the IOPC's independence and motivations.

""Had we been aware this would be suggested, we would have strongly refuted it.""

Mr Naseem said in the Panorama that he fully accepted the jury's verdict, but stood by the IOPC's decision to refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff 'thought he had died' in Top Gear crash,Cricketer-turned-TV host Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff opens up about his car crash for the first time.,Culture,"Television, BBC, Top Gear, Andrew Flintoff",Ian Youngs,2025-04-23T23:34:50.540Z,2025-04-23T23:34:50.540Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/90ef/live/d00c17f0-2063-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/90ef/live/d00c17f0-2063-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgzy8wy72o,"Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he ""was dead"" in the immediate aftermath.

The England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring programme rolled over in 2022.

Speaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he ""remembers everything about it"".

""I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything,"" he recalled.

""I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days?

""My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.""

Flintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his ""biggest fear"" was that he no longer had a face left.

""I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.""

He recalled being in ""agony"" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.

The incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.

He was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming.

Speaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries.

""As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down.

""And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,"" he added. ""But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.""

Surgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were ""very complex"" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced.

He ""lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,"" he said.

Mr Haq said the injuries were in the ""top five"" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career.

Reflecting on the recovery, Flintoff said he ""didn't think I had it in me to get through"" the ordeal.

""This sounds awful. Part of me wishes I'd been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I'd died,"" he added.

""I didn't want to kill myself. I don't want to mistake the two things. I was not wishing, but thinking, this would have been so much easier...

""Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.""

One of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is ""loving"" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.

Flintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery.

""When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,"" she said. ""It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.""

The 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash.

The acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month.

He also hosted a reboot of darts game show Bullseye over Christmas, which will return for a full series later this year.

In 2023, the BBC ""rested"" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff.

The documentary, titled Flintoff, is on Disney+ from Friday, 25 April.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgzy8wy72o
"Miliband urges global cooperation amidst energy ""challenges""",The UK Energy Secretary was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security. ,N/A,"Ed Miliband, Climate, Oil & Gas industry, Renewable energy",Esme Stallard,2025-04-24T10:50:30.532Z,2025-04-24T10:50:30.532Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f908/live/679e2200-20ed-11f0-8451-0101bb35273b.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f908/live/679e2200-20ed-11f0-8451-0101bb35273b.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8kr8k28z2o,"Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.

He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.

Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being ""weaponised"", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.

Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.

In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.

He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.

The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased ""international fragmentation"" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.

""Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.""

He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.

Global gas prices spikedfollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.

Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threatas relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.

The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a ""success"" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.

Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.

""On the big calls – like the future of global oil demand – the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,"" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation

""As countries come together to shape a new energy security paradigm, they need unbiased, dependable data on the future direction of energy,"" he added.

Miliband also read out a letter from King Charles III.

""As we all navigate the transition to cleaner energy for our planet and energy security for our citizens, summits such as these are of vital importance in facilitating shared learning between nations, particularly those in the global south and across the Commonwealth,"" King Charles wrote.

The UK government wants 95% of Great Britain's electricity mix to come from clean energy by the end of the decade -currently this stands around 60%.

Milibandtold the BBC's R4 Today programmethat this would guarantee lower energy bills by 2030.

Millions of vapes seized in England as illegal trade targeted,"Single-use vapes are among the main driving forces of the black market, the BBC is told.",England,"Vaping, London, England, Trading Standards, Newcastle upon Tyne, Disposable vapes",Alix Hattenstone,2025-04-24T02:29:13.519Z,2025-04-24T02:29:13.519Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5421/live/56e20c80-1e2a-11f0-9172-c9f961660029.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5421/live/56e20c80-1e2a-11f0-9172-c9f961660029.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnv5e6rjq2zo,"More than six million illegal vaping products have been seized by Trading Standards officers across England in the past three years, new analysis by the BBC has found. We joined one of the teams responsible for tracking down the illicit goods as they prepare for a ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes.

Paul Leighton is packing his rucksack with a heavy-duty hammer, pry bar and evidence bags for what he describes as ""just an average day out"".

As the senior Trading Standards officer at Newcastle City Council, he has learned the hiding places used to conceal illegal vapes can be sophisticated. Sometimes, he has to force his way in.

He has found them hidden everywhere from inside fridges and barbecues to behind fake fuse boxes and tiled panels complete with hydraulic lifts.

""I've seen entire kitchens come away from walls and off the floor as well… so all sorts of hiding places,"" he says.

Classified as illicit or non-compliant vapes, the products he will be searching for today fail to meet the legal requirements for sale in the UK.

More than six million of them were seized in England between 2022 and 2024, according to analysis by the BBC.

The health risks posed to unwitting customers are summed up by Connor Lamb, a senior technician for licensing also taking part in the unannounced checks on shops.

If you get a normal vape, he says, ""they've got a capacity which is enough for 600 puffs - the equivalent to 20 cigarettes"".

But if you get an illegal one, ""it can be anything from 200 cigarettes in one vape. Obviously someone buying this to go on a night out or a kid might just be chuffing on it all day and you can imagine the drastic effect that'll have on someone's lungs.""



According to Trading Standards,illicit or non-compliant vapescan be anything with tank sizes greater than 2ml, a nicotine strength of more than 20ml or labels that do not display manufacturer details and health warnings.

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency strongly advises consumers not to use them as the true content - and any possible health risk - is unknown.

On the road, Paul and Connor quickly find a stash of between 12 and 20 packs of illegal vapes at the back of a shop counter.

""It would be unusual to have so few in a shop that sells quite frequently like this, so it's just a case of where they're hiding the rest,"" says Paul.

We head to a room at the back of the shop. There is a stench of urine. It is full of litter and we are deep in seemingly empty cardboard boxes.

Paul's hunch is proven right though as a search among the rubbish unearths a box of illegal vapes.

Of 136 local Trading Standards bodies in England, 133 responded to BBC Freedom of Information requests, showing that between 2022 and 2024:

Selling illegal vapes was a factor in at least 316 shop closures during that period, while selling to children was a factor in at least 67. Most of the closures were temporary and some retailers may have been shut down more than once.

TheIndependent British Vape Trade Association(IBVTA) insists the majority of vape shops operate within the law, serving adults who would otherwise be smoking.

A spokesperson said: ""These business owners would never knowingly involve themselves in criminal activity. Rather, it is since the resurgence of popularity of single-use vapes, and therefore a popular 'cash market', that we've seen organised crime gangs get involved in importing and distributing vapes.""

They said IBVTA had long called for greater enforcement action at borders to stem the flow of illegal products entering the country.

TheDepartment of Health and Social Caresaid it was allocating an extra £10m this financial year for Trading Standards to tackle underage and illicit sales, with an expected 80 additional apprentice enforcement officers to be funded.

Paul and Connor agree single-use vapes are among the main driving forces of the illegal trade and hope the coming ban will improve the situation.

""These are quite sophisticated networks that we're up against who are also involved in lots of quite serious activities as well as modern day slavery, trafficking, drug supply,"" says Paul.

""I think we'll see a lot less product taken off the street because we haven't really had a massive issue with reusable vapes for quite some time.

""They've always been broadly compliant in terms of the devices that are being used, the batteries, the liquids, the odd oversized tank here.""

From 1 June, it will be illegal for businesses in the UK tosell, supply or possess single-use vapes for sale.

Those caught doing so will get a £200 on-the-spot fine in the first instance, rising to an unlimited fine and/or a prison sentence of up to two years for repeat offences.

The government has said Trading Standards will be able to keep the full value of the on-the-spot fines, to reinvest into enforcement.

Extra enforcement powers and funding are something IBVTA says it welcomes, noting ""not all Trading Standards teams are equally or adequately resourced"" and ""some areas with low regulatory compliance are unable to carry out the enforcement they would want to"".

But a national spokesperson for Trading Standards said its work was ""definitely having an impact"".

Government funding had enabled ""extra boots on the ground"" at Heathrow Airport and Dover Port, the spokesperson said, which explained the high number of seizures by the local authorities home to those border points – Hillingdon and Kent.

In Hillingdon alone, 2,099,248 vaping products were seized between 2022-2024, making up a third of the total.

They said Salford was home to a number of vape warehouses supplying products across England, meaning ""seizing at this stage in the supply chain is really effective"".

However, they said there was still a ""huge challenge in terms of retailers prepared to sell illegal products as well as those who persistently sell to children"".

Back in Newcastle, Paul offers a similar assessment of the task faced nationally.

He estimates the number of illegal vapes still circulating in the country is ""easily in the millions at the moment"", adding: ""It's a constant battle trying to make a difference.""

Southport: Dads running marathon say 'our girls will be with us',David Stancombe and Sergio Aguiar tell BBC daughters will be with them in spirit during London race.,UK,"Southport knife attacks, London Marathon, Fundraising","Claire Ryan, George Sandeman and Sarah Campbell",2025-04-24T04:45:07.654Z,2025-04-24T04:45:07.654Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/76d5/live/d54d35a0-2068-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/76d5/live/d54d35a0-2068-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99pkz519g2o,"Two dads whose daughters were killed at a dance class in Southport last year have told the BBC how their children will be with them in spirit as they run the London Marathon.

David Stancombe and Sergio Aguiar are raising money for projects established in their daughters' memory.Alice Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, died last Julywhile they attended a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.

Mr Aguiar tells BBC Breakfast he talks to Alice when he's running alone. ""I tell her to keep going with me, that we're going to do this together, you're going to be with me - always.""

Mr Stancombe says his daughter would be very proud of his efforts. The pair had watched coverage of the marathon on TV last year and she told him he should run the race in honour of her grandmother.

""A little bit of me was like, 'oh yeah, alright Els,'"" says Mr Stancombe. ""I just never thought I would be running it for these reasons.""

Bebe's parents, Lauren and Ben King, will both be at the marathon to support the pair, on Sunday.

""It is just incredible what they are both doing,"" says Mrs King. ""And we want to be a part of it every step of the way.""

Mrs King says it is important to the couple that they are at the roadside as they want to represent their daughter while David and Sergio, who are running in honour of their girls, are cheered towards the finish line.

""They were such wonderful, caring little children,"" she says. ""Even though none of them knew each other, they were all so similar. And I reckon they are just up there watching over us and looking out for us.""

Mr Stancombe is raising money for Elsie's Story,a charitable trust that makes grants to assist young peopleand support others in the Southport area.

""I keep saying Elsie and those other girls will live longer than us,"" says her mum, Jenni Stancombe. ""Elsie's Story and the work that we're doing in the community will continue [her legacy].""

She says the grants are for ""causes that will bring joy, happiness and support to children... Elsie wouldn't want it any other way"".

Mrs Stancombe says she chokes up at the thought of David crossing the finish line and imagining what their daughter's reaction would have been.

""She'd be shouting from the line, you'd hear her above everybody else,"" she tells us. ""She'd take his medal off him straight away.""

Mr Stancombe says around 40 friends and family will be in London to cheer him on, all wearing hoodies and t-shirts featuring the Elsie's Story logo.

""I've seen so many videos of people crying at the end of the London marathon and I can't imagine what that will be like,"" he says. ""But I want to enjoy the day. I want to do it for me and I want to do it for Elsie.""

Mrs Stancombe is certain her husband will complete the marathon, having witnessed his resilience and determination during training.

""I have absolutely no doubt, but I know it will be Elsie who'll be the one to carry him over that finish line.""

The 26.2 mile (42 km) route finishes on The Mall in central Londonand, like David, Mr Aguiar is committed to reaching it.

""Twenty-six miles, I've never done anything like that before. But for my girl, I would do 26 or 50 - whatever,"" he says. ""The pain doesn't matter, I'm going to do it.""

He is raising money to build a newplayground, including a performance stage and library, at Churchtown Primary School,where Alice was a pupil.

It will be dedicated to Alice and Bebe, who previously attended the school.

Alexandra Aguiar, Alice's mum, says her daughter would have loved to see ""her friends play on the playground that [bears] her name"".

""The fact her name will be overlooking the playground forever, that would make her feel special,"" she says. ""And [I'm sure it's the] same for Bebe.""

Mrs King agrees, saying the new playground is a fitting tribute. ""It's really special that all [Bebe's] friends from that school will have this lasting legacy of her,"" she says.

""She'd be over the moon that she could bring some happiness to her friends and the kids of Churchtown.""

Ms Aguiar also feels her daughter will be accompanying her dad in spirit during the marathon. ""She's always with us. And she's going to be there helping daddy.""

She says she knows how Alice would have celebrated his efforts: ""She would have made a big thing of it and told everyone. She would also bring her shopping list to do after the marathon!""

Running alongside Mr Aguiar will be Jinnie Payne, the headteacher of Churchtown Primary School.

She says she has been struck by his courage to run and focus on the playground project.

""His determination [and] his resilience give me so much strength,"" says Ms Payne. The project, she says, is ultimately about Southport remembering the girls.

Mrs Stancombe and Ms Aguiar will be at the marathon to support their husbands. However, both say it will be their daughters - not them - who helps them cross the finish line.

Tax-free parcels rule used by Shein and Temu under review,Retailers argue that cheap foreign rivals are undercutting business using a tax-free status on small parcels.,Business,"Online shopping, Trump tariffs, Retailing, British Retail Consortium, Temu",Faarea Masud,2025-04-24T10:02:10.632Z,2025-04-24T12:48:35.165Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0009/live/045609f0-2116-11f0-8c58-0f3e2186d95e.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0009/live/045609f0-2116-11f0-8c58-0f3e2186d95e.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c078j4kylz3o,"Major retailers have welcomed the government's review of a rule that allows small parcels to enter the UK duty-free, saying it gives overseas firms such as Shein and Temu an unfair advantage over British businesses.

The current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than £135 without incurring import taxes.

Former Dragon's Den star Theo Paphitis, whose retail group includes the Ryman and Robert Dyas, told the BBC the measure was ruining UK High Streets.

Some retailers have argued they are being undercut by overseas rivals, but a body representing small businesses said scrapping the exemption could raise costs for them and price rises for customers.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced on Wednesday that the government planned to review the customs treatment of low-value products entering the UK following complaints from retailers.

The explosion of parcels being shipped under the measure has prompted increased scrutiny in recent years. While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen their sales soar.

It has fuelled the rise of Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, which ship low-value packages to the UK and other countries to reach millions of customers.

Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government ""for a very, very long time"", arguing the rule had had devastating impact ""on our retail landscape and our high streets"".

He joined the bosses of Sainsbury's, Currys and the British Retail Consortium in welcoming the government's consultation on the rule.

UK businesses bringing in larger shipments have to pay taxes, and they also argue that cheaper goods might fail to meet the same environmental and ethical standards that they keep to.

Aside from concerns over unfair competition with domestic retailers, it has also been raised that governments could be missing out on potential tax income.

The so called ""de minimis"" rule has received renewed interest after US president Donald Trump scrapped a similar measure in America amid his escalating trade war with China.

Goods worth less than $800 into the US will soon be subject to charges, where they were previously exempt. The move has already prompted Chinese retailers to raise their prices.

In the UK, there are further concerns that China will dump goods here to avoid the tariffs which Trump has imposed on Chinese goods.

Earlier this month, the boss of Currystold the Financial Timesthat the ""single biggest area where lots of stock is likely to land in the UK... is from the likes of Shein, Temu, Alibaba, TikTok shop and, most of all, Amazon marketplace"".

On Thursday, Alex Baldock told the BBC he was pleased the government was ""reviewing the low-value shipment loophole, and that they're committed to levelling the playing field between British and overseas retailers"".

But the Federation of Small Businesses urged the government to proceed with caution in its de minimis consultation, suggesting that scrapping it might ""ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers"".

""With 16% of goods moved by small firms sitting below the £135 threshold, a decision to scrap it impacts on trading and inflation,"" said Tina McKenzie, chair of the FSB.

""It's right to be concerned about potential future dumping of goods, as escalating tariffs applied by bigger global blocs against each other may mean a surge in goods arriving in markets like our own,"" she added.



Mr Paphitis told the BBC it was ""absolute nonsense"" that the measure kept inflation and prices down, arguing it led to a loss of jobs and tax revenue for the UK, due to businesses being unable to compete with cheaper foreign rivals.

Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for retailers, said the review was ""more critical now"" due to a ""rise in the number of potentially non-compliant products entering the UK market"".

The British Independent Retailers Association said small packages having no tax or charges was a key concern. It called on ministers to act to ""deter import surges"" in order to ""protect independent retailers"".

When Sainsbury's announced their latest financial results earlier this month, boss Simon Roberts called on the government to act as soon as possible.

""Everyone should pay their tax... so if there's a loophole here which means that's not happening then that needs to be closed so it's a level playing field for everybody,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c078j4kylz3o
Magician who pretended to be a man given Magic Circle membership,"Sophie Lloyd disguised herself as a man to join the Magic Circle in 1991, when female magicians were not allowed membership.",Culture,"Women, Magicians, Magic",Grace Dean,2025-04-23T23:09:29.936Z,2025-04-24T10:32:35.597Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c726/live/e834ee10-2054-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c726/live/e834ee10-2054-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy79nq4yz4o,"A magician who tricked her way into the Magic Circle is finally being granted membership - 34 years after she was kicked out.

Sophie Lloyd says she disguised herself as a man to fool examiners into letting her join the elite society in 1991, at a time female magicians were not allowed to be members.

When the Circle announced it was permitting women to join later that year, Ms Lloyd revealed her deception, prompting the society to expel her at the very same meeting it admitted its first female magicians.

Following a public search to find her, the Circle has now apologised to Ms Lloyd and is presenting her with a membership certificate on Thursday evening.

""I'm beyond thrilled,"" Ms Lloyd toldRadio 4's Today programmeon Thursday.

In the late 1980s, Ms Lloyd was studying at a school of mime in London where she befriended magician Jenny Winstanley.

""Jenny was increasingly frustrated that women, including herself, could not join the Magic Circle,"" Ms Lloyd said. ""So she came up with an idea to infiltrate the society by having me dress as a man. She couldn't do it herself as she was too recognisable.""

It was a colossal undertaking. Ms Lloyd had worked as Miss Winstanley's assistant at gigs but hadn't performed magic on her own, so had to learn.

She invented a new identity - Raymond Lloyd - and spent about two years studying the character. She disguised herself with a wig, body suit and ""croaky"" voice. She wore gloves to hide her feminine hands.

There was nothing she could do about her height - 5ft 2in (1.57m) - so instead she styled Raymond as a ""young-looking, 18-year-old,"" with some facial ""fluff"", she told Canadian broadcasterCBCin 1991.

Ms Lloyd told the Today programme that her character was ""totally believed."" She had no problems wearing the body suit, but the gloves made it ""very hard"" to do sleight of hand tricks, she said.

By March 1991, Ms Lloyd was ready to have her skills put to the test. Rather than being scrutinised at the Magic Circle's headquarters - which Ms Lloyd and Miss Winstanley deemed too risky - Ms Lloyd opted to invite the society's examiners to a 20-minute performance at a working men's club in front of 200 spectators. To cover up her voice, Ms Lloyd said Raymond had laryngitis.

Ms Lloyd even stayed for a drink with one of the examiners after the show.

A week later, Ms Lloyd was told she had been granted membership to the Circle.

For months, Raymond Lloyd performed magic and even socialised with other Magic Circle members.

When Ms Lloyd and Miss Winstanley later heard the society was going to begin accepting female magicians as members, they decided to come clean about their deception and Miss Winstanley told the society about it over the phone.

But the Magic Circle did not take kindly to the news. The duo got a letter saying that Raymond had been expelled, and in October 1991, at the first meeting accepting women into the society, Ms Lloyd was kicked out.

""We couldn't get our heads round it,"" Ms Lloyd said.

Ms Lloyd spent about 10 years performing across the country as a magician, including performing anti-bullying shows, before she moved to Spain, where she took early retirement and has been involved in animal rescue work. Miss Winstanley went on to run a pottery firm in Norfolk, before she died in a car crash in 2004.

The Magic Circle started a search for Ms Lloyd last year.

""I felt it important that the Magic Circle should be able to recognise Sophie as the role model for women magicians, as well as show that we are now a completely open society,"" said Laura London, the society's first female chair.

Ms Lloyd only found out about the search for her when her sister sent her a link to an interview. Initially reluctant to join the society because of the amount of time that had passed, she eventually decided to do it to honour Miss Winstanley's legacy.

Today, the Magic Circle is still heavily male-dominated. The society has around 1,700 members, of which 5% are women.

Ms Lloyd will receive her new membership certificate at an event at the Circle's London headquarters on Thursday evening, which will feature performances by five magicians and be attended by both members of the society and the general public. The society says Miss Winstanley will also be recognised at the event.

""This is for Jenny, really,"" Ms Lloyd said. ""I just think Jenny would have loved it.""

Ofcom finalises rules for tech firms to protect children online,Websites will have to instate age checks and tighten up algorithm recommendations for young users. ,Technology,"Online Safety Bill, Social media, Ofcom",Hafsa Khalil & Imran Rahman-Jones,2025-04-24T07:00:22.669Z,2025-04-24T11:20:59.780Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1ac0/live/9dd349a0-20d8-11f0-b0e5-d9ee068af7b4.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1ac0/live/9dd349a0-20d8-11f0-b0e5-d9ee068af7b4.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yljn2vkn1o,"Websites will have to change the algorithms that recommend content to young people and introduce beefed-up age checks or face big fines, the UK media regulator has confirmed.

Ofcom says its ""Children's Codes"" - the final versions of which have now been published - will offer ""transformational new protections"".

Platforms which host pornography, or offer content which encourages self-harm, suicide or eating disorders are among those which must take more robust action to prevent children accessing their content.

Ofcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes said it was a ""gamechanger"" but critics say the restrictions do not go far enough and were ""a bitter pill to swallow"".

Ian Russell, chairman of the Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up in memory of his daughter - who took her own life aged 14 - said he was ""dismayed by the lack of ambition"" in the codes.

But Dame Melanie told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that age checks were a first step as ""unless you know where children are, you can't give them a different experience to adults.

""There is never anything on the internet or in real life that is fool proof… [but] this represents a gamechanger.""

She admitted that while she was ""under no illusions"" that some companies ""simply either don't get it or don't want to"", but emphasised the Codes had legal force.

""If they want to serve the British public and if they want the privilege in particular in offering their services to under 18s, then they are going to need to change the way those services operate.""

Prof Victoria Baines, a former safety officer at Facebook told the BBC it is ""a step in the right direction"".

Talking to the Today Programme, she said: ""Big tech companies are really getting to grips with it , so they are putting money behind it, and more importantly they're putting people behind it.""

Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said key to the rules was tackling the algorithms which decide what children get shown online.

""The vast majority of kids do not go searching for this material, it just lands in their feeds,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.

Kyle toldThe Telegraphhe was separately looking into a social media curfew for under-16s, but would not ""act on something that will have a profound impact on every single child in the country without making sure that the evidence supports it"".

Thenew rulesfor platforms are subject to parliamentary approval under the Online Safety Act.

The regulator says they contain more than 40 practical measures tech firms must take, including:

If companies fail to abide by the regulations, Ofcom said it has ""the power to impose fines and - in very serious cases - apply for a court order to prevent the site or app from being available in the UK.""

Children's charity the NSPCC broadly welcomed the Codes, calling them ""a pivotal moment for children's safety online.""

But they called for Ofcom to go further, especially when it came to private messaging apps which are often encrypted - meaning platforms cannot see what is being sent.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yljn2vkn1o
Tax-free parcels rule used by Shein and Temu under review,Retailers argue that cheap foreign rivals are undercutting business using a tax-free status on small parcels.,Business,"Online shopping, Trump tariffs, Retailing, British Retail Consortium, Temu",Faarea Masud,2025-04-24T10:02:10.632Z,2025-04-24T12:48:35.165Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0009/live/045609f0-2116-11f0-8c58-0f3e2186d95e.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0009/live/045609f0-2116-11f0-8c58-0f3e2186d95e.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c078j4kylz3o,"Major retailers have welcomed the government's review of a rule that allows small parcels to enter the UK duty-free, saying it gives overseas firms such as Shein and Temu an unfair advantage over British businesses.

The current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than £135 without incurring import taxes.

Former Dragon's Den star Theo Paphitis, whose retail group includes the Ryman and Robert Dyas, told the BBC the measure was ruining UK High Streets.

Some retailers have argued they are being undercut by overseas rivals, but a body representing small businesses said scrapping the exemption could raise costs for them and price rises for customers.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced on Wednesday that the government planned to review the customs treatment of low-value products entering the UK following complaints from retailers.

The explosion of parcels being shipped under the measure has prompted increased scrutiny in recent years. While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen their sales soar.

It has fuelled the rise of Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, which ship low-value packages to the UK and other countries to reach millions of customers.

Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government ""for a very, very long time"", arguing the rule had had devastating impact ""on our retail landscape and our high streets"".

He joined the bosses of Sainsbury's, Currys and the British Retail Consortium in welcoming the government's consultation on the rule.

UK businesses bringing in larger shipments have to pay taxes, and they also argue that cheaper goods might fail to meet the same environmental and ethical standards that they keep to.

Aside from concerns over unfair competition with domestic retailers, it has also been raised that governments could be missing out on potential tax income.

The so called ""de minimis"" rule has received renewed interest after US president Donald Trump scrapped a similar measure in America amid his escalating trade war with China.

"Exhausted hospital staff putting patients at risk, says watchdog",NHS safety body wants a focus on staff fatigue as it warns of mistakes and impaired decision-making.,Health,"Health, NHS",Nick Triggle,2025-04-24T01:15:48.763Z,2025-04-24T01:15:48.763Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/036e/live/433df8a0-2051-11f0-9177-cd94edc26715.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/036e/live/433df8a0-2051-11f0-9177-cd94edc26715.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6jz3z7en6o,"Extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patients, England's NHS safety watchdog warns.

The Health Services Safety Investigations Body said medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention and rude and disrespectful behaviour were the most common problems associated with fatigued staff in hospitals.

It said there was limited data on the scale of the problem, but cited evidence from staff surveys and information provided by safety experts that it was a contributory factor in safety incidents.

In its report, the watchdog gave examples of mistakes being made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs.



In one case a mother and baby were harmed after an inaccurate scan, with the staff member saying fatigue and workload contributed.

In the chemotherapy case the staff were nearly nine hours into a 12.5-hour day shift and had only managed five to six hours of sleep between shifts and had limited breaks because of staffing pressures.

The hospital investigation found fatigue was ""likely to have been a factor"".



Some staff reported being sleep-deprived on a daily basis.

And one doctor told the watchdog: ""When it gets to that third day of doing these 12-hour nights it's dangerous from 2am onwards... do I have the energy or the brain space or the mental space to even make a life-changing decision for a patient at this point?""

The watchdog said exhaustion was also a risk to staff themselves with some complaining of nodding off at the wheel on the way home and reports of staff dying in road accidents after work.

Shift work, long working hours, lack of breaks, caring responsibilities and financial pressures were all cited as factors in staff fatigue.

The watchdog said the issue was often misunderstood in the NHS and thought of more as a wellbeing issue rather than a safety issue.

It said the government and NHS England needed to introduce better systems to monitor fatigue and work with unions and employers to raise awareness about it.





Senior safety investigator Saskia Fursland said: ""Fatigue is more than just being tired - it can significantly impair decision-making, motor skills, and alertness.

""We must move away from viewing fatigue as an individual issue and putting the onus on personal responsibility and instead treat it as a system-level risk that deserves urgent attention.""

Dr Latifa Patel, of the British Medical Association, said the findings were concerning, but not surprising with doctors facing long shifts back-to-back with little respite.

She said there needed to be better rota design to ensure staff could rest properly between shifts and improved rest facilities in hospitals.

But she said fatigue was also ""often driven by workforce shortages"" too.

A spokesperson for NHS England said it recognised staff were at risk of burnout and was ""committed"" to ensuring they got the support they needed to provide safe care.

""Staff should always feel confident to report patient safety concerns, including those that are linked to fatigue, and we will work with local NHS systems to address any issues,"" he added.

He said the NHS was offering more flexible working options than ever before and there was a range of mental health support available for staff.

Water industry admits sewage monitoring damaging public trust,The industry says powers to self-monitor water quality should be handed back to the regulator. ,Science & Environment,"Sewage, Environment, Water",Esme Stallard,2025-04-24T01:09:03.992Z,2025-04-24T01:09:03.992Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7c5d/live/17032aa0-2063-11f0-82ef-73284b78c058.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7c5d/live/17032aa0-2063-11f0-82ef-73284b78c058.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxngw96qrgo,"Water companies should no longer be allowed to monitor their own levels of sewage pollution, the industry body has told the BBC exclusively.

Instead they are proposing a new, third-party monitoring system to build consumer trust.

The recommendation is part of a submission made to the UK government's independent review into the water sector.

Campaigners have long complained the companies' self-reporting has prevented the true scale of pollution in UK water being revealed.

A third-party system could add more pressure to the regulators, which have also been criticised for not holding the companies to account.

A report from the National Audit Office examining the three water regulators (Ofwat, the Environment Agency, and the Drinking Water Inspectorate) and Defra, is expected on Friday.

David Henderson, CEO of industry body Water UK, told the BBC: ""We absolutely accept that self-monitoring is not helping to instil trust and so we would like to see an end to it, and in place of it a more robust, third-party system.""

As part of their permitting arrangements water companies are expected to regularly sample water quality to identify potential pollution, and submit this data to the Environment Agency in an arrangement known as ""operator self monitoring"".

But there have been incidents of misreporting by water companies in England and Wales uncovered by the regulators, who said some cases had been deliberate.

Southern Waterwas previously issued finestotalling £213m by the industry regulator (Ofwat) and the environmental regulator (the Environment Agency) for manipulating sewage data.

In that case, there was unreported pollution into numerous conservation sites whichcaused ""major environmental harm""to wildlife.

The company later admitted its actions ""fell short"".

Henderson added that the industry never asked to self-monitor, but that it was introduced in 2009 by the then Labour government to ""reduce the administrative burden"" on the Environment Agency (EA).

In 2023,the BBC reportedthat EA staff were concerned that, due to funding cuts, the Agency was increasingly relying on water companies to self-report rather than carrying out its own checks on pollution from sewage.

The current environment minister, Steve Reed, has promised to review the system,calling itthe equivalent of companies ""mark[ing] their own homework"".

But the National Audit Office (NAO), which reviews government spending, questioned the ability of regulators, like the EA, to take on any new monitoring.

""Regulators need to address the fact that they currently have limited oversight over whether water companies are carrying out their work as expected. It is hard to see how they will achieve this without increased overall capacity,"" said Anita Shah, NAO Director of Regulation.

It is expected to publish a full review of the regulation of the water sector on Friday.

A Defra spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are committed to taking decisive action to fix the water industry. The Water Commission's recommendations will mark the next major step [to] restore public trust in the sector.""

The government launched an independent water commission in October to review the sector and the way it is regulated. The public consultation closed on Wednesday with the findings expected in July.

Water UK submitted a 200-page document of recommendations, including this call to end self-monitoring.

The industry body also requested that water meters be universal across England and Wales to make bills fairer. At present about 60% of the population have a meter.

""The meter is just to ensure that people are paying for what they use as opposed to a flat rate of system where you can use virtually no water and pay the same as someone filling up a pool three times in a summer,"" said Henderson.

""This doesn't properly reflect the value of water and encourage people to conserve it in the way that we need,"" he added.

"Killers and stalkers should live in restricted zones, say victims","Rhianon Bragg, who was stalked by her ex-partner, felt ""trapped"" when he was released from prison.",Wales,"Wales, Stalking, Crime, Sentencing in England and Wales",Gemma Dunstan,2025-04-23T22:01:29.005Z,2025-04-24T05:03:16.725Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d4b7/live/3d557460-206d-11f0-82ef-73284b78c058.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d4b7/live/3d557460-206d-11f0-82ef-73284b78c058.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8gr62ym4ko,"People who have committed murder, manslaughter or stalking offences should be forced to live in restricted areas after being released from prison on licence, campaigners have said.

Rhianon Bragg said she felt ""trapped"" after her stalker was released from prison subject to an exclusion zone, which meant he could not enter the surrounding four counties of her home.

The Ministry of Justice said exclusion zones prevented offenders from approaching their victims.

But Ms Bragg is part of a group of victims who say this approach should be ""flipped on its head"", with ""high risk"" former prisoners only able to live, work and travel in specific areas of the UK for the rest of their lives.

Some experts have raised concerns that such an approach could amount to a breach of perpetrators' human rights.

Ms Bragg, from Gwynedd,was stalked and held at gunpoint for eight hoursby her ex-partner Gareth Wyn Jones in 2019.

Jones wasjailed for four-and-a half-years in 2020and later released on licence in February 2024.

Being on licence means that a person is still serving a prison sentence but can live in the community under strict conditions.

As part of Jones' licence conditions he was not allowed to enter the surrounding four counties of Ms Bragg's home for a period of five years, but Ms Bragg said she began to feel ""trapped"".

""We hadn't got freedom anymore, not truly,"" she said.

""It may sound like a large area, but the clock was ticking.

""Just simply travelling and worrying about stopping at a service station that he might be there,"" she added.

""Being outside the safety zone did feel like a real a risk, and it shouldn't be like that.""

Ms Bragg recently found out that Jones had died.

""The morning after I'd been told that news, I couldn't work out what I was feeling, I couldn't put a name on it, it felt different, it wasn't familiar, and then it suddenly came to me - it was freedom,"" she said.

""Victims have been through enough already, we should all be able to feel freedom.""

Emma King said she had to ""fight"" for a five-mile exclusion zone around her home from the man who killed her sister.

Julie Butcherwas murdered in 2005 by her ex-husbandRichard Butcher at their home in Chiseldon, Wiltshire.

Butcher was jailed for 13 years but Ms King said he wanted to move back to the same area after being released.

""We are actually imprisoned ourselves now in a small area and will be forever looking over our shoulders,"" said Ms King.

She said 50-mile (80km) exclusion zones should be the minimum imposed on perpetrators, and that they should be imposed at sentencing to avoid further trauma for the families of victims.

Ms King has joined forces with Carole Gould, whose17-year-old daughter Ellie was stabbed to deathat her home in Calne, Wiltshire, in 2019, by Thomas Griffiths after she ended their relationship.

After hearing about Ms King's experiences, Ms Gould said she said she was ""horrified"".

""Naively I just thought Griffiths won't be allowed back to the south west of England [after being released] but hearing what Emma has to say, that means Griffiths could move back and live with his parents who have chosen not to move out of the area,"" Ms Gould said.

""They don't take into account the anxiety we're living with right now, let alone the grief, for what we should do for our long term plans.

""Should we move away or sit it out and see what happens?""

Diana Parkes, whose daughter Joanna Simpson was killed at her home in Berkshire in 2010, has also endorsed the calls for restricted zones.

Ms Parkes, who set up theJoanna Simpson Trustin her daughter's name to support children affected by domestic abuse and homicide, said victims were ""absolutely terrified"" when perpetrators came out of prison.

""Every single victim I have spoken to endorses this feeling that the offender should be in a restricted zone and the victim should be able to carry on their life, because they've done nothing wrong,"" said Ms Parkes.

""Why should they only be made to feel safe in an exclusion zone?

""I'm fighting like mad until my dying breath to make sure people understand. Particularly the law makers, if they had lost a family member like us, they would really truly think differently.""

Latest Ministry of Justice data showed 62,821 people were on licence or subject to post release supervision as of September 2024.

Craig Court, a solicitor at Harding Evans, in south Wales, who has represented both prisoners and victims of abuse, said introducing restricted zones in which offenders could live and work would pose a ""real risk"" of breaching the Human Rights Act 1998.

He said the act had played a significant role in shaping how licence conditions were applied to offenders.

""Victims' campaigns have rightly highlighted the need for more restrictive conditions to ensure their safety and psychological wellbeing,"" said Mr Court.

""While I agree that such restrictive measures are crucial, especially where there is a continuing risk of harm, the act requires that any restriction - such as preventing an offender from entering certain areas - must comply with Article 5 [right to liberty] and Article 8 [right to private and family life] of the European Convention of Human Rights.""

Mr Court said these provisions did not prohibit restrictive conditions but did require them to be proportionate, necessary, and grounded in a clear assessment of ongoing risk.

He said the aim was to protect the needs of victims whilst not undermining the fundamental rights of offenders.

""As the law currently stands, confining an offender to a particular area or restricting an offender from leaving a defined area runs the real risk of breaching both Articles 5 and or 8,"" he added.

Ms Gould said she felt the emphasis should be ""flipped on its head"".

""It's all about the perpetrators' human rights and not ours, and that's so wrong,"" she said.

""The radius should be put on them. So we know where they are and we have the freedom of the UK.""

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Victims must feel safe, which is why any offenders released on licence who break the rules face going back to prison.

""They have to follow strict conditions, such as curfews and exclusion zones that prevent them approaching their victims, as well as restrictions on phone and internet use.""

Lucy, 32, a special needs teacher who lives near Sonning Common in Oxfordshire, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at 12 weeks pregnant.

At 20 weeks, a team of 15 doctors at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford carried out a five-hour operation to remove the cancerous cells on both ovaries, behind the womb.

Her womb and son were then returned to her body and her baby was born at the end of January, weighing 6lb 5oz (3kg).

Ovarian cancer affects 7,000 women every year in the UK and more than 4,000 women a year die from it, according to Cancer Research UK.

Doctors feared if they waited until the baby was born to treat Lucy's tumour, the cancer would likely spread and pose a risk to her life.

But her pregnancy was too far advanced to allow surgeons to perform standard keyhole surgery.

The procedure, with risks to both mother and child, has only been carried out a handful of times across the world.

Lucy said she took a pregnancy test early in the summer of 2024 and there was ""lots of excitement"" when it came back positive.

She recalled going for the routine 12-week scan at the Royal Berkshire Hospital.

""The sonographer talked us through the baby, who was looking really healthy and then she just went really quiet,"" she said.

""Just for a few minutes Adam and I were just looking at each other thinking, 'oh gosh something's obviously a little bit off and she's not happy'.

""Then she said, there is something on here Lucy, it's on your ovary and I think you need to see a specialist.""

The womb remained connected to the uterine artery to maintain a supply of blood and oxygen to the baby, during the five-hour operation.

It also stayed attached to the left fallopian tube and cervix.

Two members of the team held Lucy's womb in their hands during the entire procedure.

It was wrapped in a warm, sterile saline pack to mimic being inside the body and to keep it at the right temperature.

Hooman Soleymani Majd, a consultant in gynaecological oncology, described it as a ""complex and challenging"" procedure.

""The dedication and expertise of our multidisciplinary team ensured a positive outcome for both Lucy and her baby,"" he said.

Lucy said she felt in ""very safe hands"" during her time in hospital.

""Every doctor, nurse we spoke to was lovely, supportive, knowledgeable gave us the reassurance that we needed,"" she explained.

""I didn't for one second doubt that we weren't going to be very well looked after.""

Lucy had not showed symptoms before the ovarian cancer was discovered and said she felt ""incredibly lucky"" to have been diagnosed and treated.

She said now her son had arrived, ""safe and sound"", she would have her completion surgery next month.

""For me, that's the main thing that he is here, he is healthy,"" she continued.

""Ever since that 12-week scan, there was so much in my pregnancy that we felt, 'If we get to meet our baby...' rather than, 'When we get to meet our baby...'.""

Judge orders Scottish schools to provide single-sex toilets,A case was brought against Scottish Borders Council which had installed only gender neutral toilets in a replacement school.   ,South Scotland,"Gender recognition reform in Scotland, Women's rights, Earlston, Transgender people",BBC News,2025-04-23T17:18:34.417Z,2025-04-23T17:54:32.261Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/885d/live/e85351e0-205c-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/885d/live/e85351e0-205c-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jz5ed7lv5o,"A judge has ordered that Scottish schools must provide single-sex toilets for students after parents brought a case to court against Scottish Borders Council (SBC).

The local authority had installed only gender neutral toilets at the replacement Earlston primary school, which recently opened.

Parents Sean Stratford and Leigh Hurley complained to the council about the policy at the school their son had previously attended, but it was rejected.

But at the Court of Session in Edinburgh the council conceded that they had a legal obligation to provide male and female facilities.

The move comes after judges at the UK Supreme Court last week unanimously ruled that a woman isdefined by biological sexunder equalities law.

Rosie Walker, of law firm Gilson Gray which is representing the parents, said: ""This case will have far reaching implications.""

BBC Scotland News understands that the Scottish government is confident that the vast majority of schools in Scotland already offer single-sex lavatories.

Ministers are still considering the implication of the Supreme Court judgement and whether any changes will have to be made to toilet provisions.

Ms Walker said all schools in Scotland would now have to ""urgently review"" whether half of their toilets are for boys and half for girls, as is required by theSchool Premises (General Requirements and Standards) (Scotland) Regulations 1967.

She added: ""This case, on top of the Supreme Court decision last week, gives focus to the importance of protecting sex-based rights and single-sex spaces.""

A council spokesperson said: ""Prior to the hearing, SBC had accepted and acknowledged the decision that was being sought was correct and therefore did not seek to defend this in court.

""Moving forward, SBC will revisit and reconsider the complaint and respond in due course.""

The Scottish government said it would carefully consider the implications of that ruling.

A spokesperson added: ""Local authorities have statutory responsibility for the school estate, including provision of toilets.

""The Scottish government is committed to ensuring that our Transgender Guidance for Schools remains up to date and fit for purpose.

""As with any significant legal or policy developments, we will consider whether the guidance requires to be updated to reflect upon these.""

They added the social justice secretary and the health secretary will meet with the  Equality and Human Rights Commission - which will soon publish guidance on the issue - on Thursday.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jz5ed7lv5o
Vehicles to be freed from car park after two years,It is thought up to 40 vehicles have been trapped in a building complex car park since December 2022.,London,"London, City of Westminster",James W Kelly & Matt Graveling ,2025-04-24T05:11:52.581Z,2025-04-24T11:57:38.313Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f735/live/6ae80c60-206a-11f0-82ef-73284b78c058.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f735/live/6ae80c60-206a-11f0-82ef-73284b78c058.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20z46p0p6jo,"Vehicles trapped in a central London mechanical stacked car park are being released after more than two years.

An email, seen by BBC London, has been sent to vehicle owners by the management company for Rathbone Square, CBRE. It said three-hour slots would be available from Thursday until 23 May for collections to be facilitated.

Small business co-owners Mark Lucas and Steve Davies, whose then-new Vauxhall Vivaro van became trapped in the building complex near Oxford Street in December 2022, said the saga had left them more than £46,000 out of pocket.

CBRE declined to comment on what caused the car park malfunction and whether owners could claim for financial losses.

A resident in the Rathbone Square development told BBC London up to 40 vehicles might be trapped. CBRE did not respond when asked to confirm this number.

A stacked car park is a system in which cars are parked on top of each other, using mechanical platforms and lifts, in order to make best use of the available space.

The email sets out the ""step-by-step guide to vehicle retrieval"" and states the ""car stacker will remain closed to all vehicles, to allow vehicle owners time to retrieve their vehicles"".

Mr Davies, co-owner of HCS Furniture in Buckinghamshire, said it had been a ""long time coming"" but he and his business partner were ""very excited"" to be collecting the van - however, he is unsure what condition its battery will be in.

""We're going to get it low-loaded so that we can get it back to our place to make sure it's OK, rather than risk driving it in whatever state it is in,"" he said.

""The first thing we're going to do is is take it down to the Vauxhall garage that we got it from so that they can service it and do a diagnostic test on the battery and to find out if it's suffered at all.""

The additional cost of renting the low-loader lorry and servicing the van will need to be assessed before the business can put in a final claim, Mr Davies said.

Lauren Kennedy, a mechanic based in Finchley, said the owners could find their vehicles in varying conditions.

""They're definitely going to have flat batteries, that's for sure. But they're also going to possibly have flat tyres, perished tyres, seized brakes.""

People with keyless systems may also struggle to get into their car if the batteries are flat.

Ms Kennedy said the drivers will probably need recovery teams with them to get their vehicles out and transported home.



Derek Millard-Smith, a solicitor specialising in parking law, said as well as any direct monetary costs incurred, the owners may also be able to claim for the inconvenience caused and ""loss of enjoyment"" of their vehicles.

""It's quantifying that time, which is the nature of any civil claim that you'd have to set out what you think your losses were,"" he said.

""And it is for the other side to say that they weren't that much if they didn't want to pay that much out.""

Double Parking Systems, which did not install but maintains the automated system at Rathbone Square, confirmed to the BBC last week that the parking system had been operational since 15 March.

Mr Davies said the whole experience had been ""dreadful"", in particular the poor communication they have had from CBRE.

""If they'd just communicated better and told us what was really happening, it wouldn't have been so traumatic,"" he said.

BBC London has contacted CBRE several times since early April but the firm would only confirm that the car park system was now fixed.

Raymond McCourt: Murderer missing from Dundee jail in suit and tie,Raymond McCourt was given a life sentence in 1993 for killing a shopkeeper and wounding two other people. ,Tayside & Central Scotland,"Scotland, Prisons, Dundee",BBC News,2025-04-24T02:09:47.472Z,2025-04-24T08:40:34.601Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c105/live/2a7c2950-20cd-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c105/live/2a7c2950-20cd-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4e8n3539o,"A convicted murderer has gone on the run from an open prison near Dundee.

Raymond McCourt, 59, who shot a shopkeeper in 1993, was reported missing from HMP Castle Huntly wearing a suit and tie.

McCourt, from Glasgow, was previously released on licence in 2015 but was sent back to jail for theft just weeks later.

A court at the time heard he had struggled with freedom and wanted to be back behind bars. Police Scotland has warned the public not to approach him.

The force said McCourt absconded from Castle Huntly at 17:30 on Tuesday.

It is understood that the alarm was raised when McCourt did not return to the prison following a period of leave.

A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""Raymond uses public transport and has connections to the Glasgow and Edinburgh areas.

""He is described as being 6ft 2in tall, stocky build with short grey hair and beard and has reduced mobility.""

McCourt was jailed at the age of 27 for murdering shopkeeper Khalid Mahmood in Cambuslang, Lanarkshire, in 1993.

He shot him in the head before attempting to rob a nearby bakery.

McCourt also shot local woman Moira Rooney and PC Brian Williams, who was giving chase as he fled the scene of the incident.

He was jailed for offences including murder, attempted murder, assault and robbery, assault to severe injury and firearms offences.

McCourt wasreleased on licence in 2015and went to live with his partner Agnes Hailes in Alyth, Perthshire.

But Perth Sheriff Court heard that he then stole from her and sold off her valuables.

He used the money to pay for a holiday to Blackpool before he was eventually tracked down by police.

He told officers that he was struggling to cope with life outside prison, and had stolen the items to have a blow-out before returning to jail.

McCourt was given a 10-month term for the theft and was recalled to prison on his life sentence.

HMP Castle Huntly is Scotland's only open prison.

Police Scotland has asked for anyone withinformation on McCourt to get in touch.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g4e8n3539o
Kneecap say statement at Coachella 'not aggressive' after criticism,Kneecap ended their performance at the California music festival with pro-Palestinian messages.,Northern Ireland,"Belfast, Israel-Gaza war, Northern Ireland, Hip-hop, Music",Claire Quinn,2025-04-23T13:21:06.927Z,2025-04-23T18:52:03.841Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a16f/live/d4362450-203c-11f0-99e1-773f439bd3c0.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a16f/live/d4362450-203c-11f0-99e1-773f439bd3c0.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dr6xvk5x3o,"The west Belfast rap group Kneecap have hit back at acall for their US visas to be revokedafter their performance at Coachella where they ended their set with pro-Palestinian messages.

Writing on social media, TV personality and music manager Sharon Osbourne said the hip-hop trio ""took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements"".

When asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: ""Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.""

The festival's organisers have also been approached for comment.

Kneecap have been vocal supporters of the Palestinian people, often raising the conflict in their live performances.

Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages.

Israel launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed 51,240 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to figures released by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

The number of children who have been killed in Gaza is disputed. International journalists including the BBC are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently so are unable to independently verify figures.

Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ , Kneecap's manager said: ""If somebody is hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by, but it's really important to speak truth.""

Daniel Lambert added: ""Thankfully the lads are not afraid to do that.""

He also said the band had received death threats following their performance at Coachella and described the threats as ""too severe to get into"".

In a statement to BBC News NI, the US State Department said when considering revocations, they look at information that ""may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted"".

The band are set to play a number of shows in the US and Canada in coming months.

On Tuesday, Osbourne claimed on social media the band's actions included ""projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech"".

""This band openly support terrorist organizations,"" she added.

Ms Osbourne was also critical of the organisers of the festival, Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).

""Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked,"" Osbourne said.

""However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence,"" she continued.

""This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,"" Osbourne said.

""I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap,"" she said.

Osbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent.

She also managed her husband's solo career.

Osbourne finished her post by saying: ""As someone of both Irish Catholic on my mother's side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on her father's side and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved.

""I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.""

The festival organisers have been approached for comment.

Warning: This article features language that some readers may find offensive

At the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, which was not streamed on the festival's official YouTube page, Kneecap projected three screens of text.

The first message said: ""Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,"" followed by: ""It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,"" and a final screen added: ""[Expletive] Israel. Free Palestine.""

During the performance, band member Mo Chara said: ""The Irish not so long ago were persecuted at the hands of the Brits, but we were never bombed from the... skies with nowhere to go.

""The Palestinians have nowhere to go.""

The band also led the audience in chants of: ""Free, free Palestine"".

On 11 April, during Kneecap's first Coachella performance, the group faced criticism after leading an anti-Margaret Thatcher chant - which was subsequently omitted from the festival's livestream - along with calls for a united Ireland.

A US State Department spokesperson said: ""Due to privacy and other considerations, and visa confidentiality, we generally will not comment on department actions with respect to specific cases.""

They said the Trump administration ""is focused on protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process"".

""When considering revocations, the department looks at information that arises after the visa was issued that may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted,"" they added.

""This can include everything from arrests, criminal convictions, and engaging in conduct that is inconsistent with the visa classification, to an overstay.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dr6xvk5x3o
Rachel Reeves signals UK could lower US car tariffs in push for trade deal,"UK negotiators are working ""flat out"" to get a trade deal with the US, Chancellor Rachel Reeves says.",Business,"Rachel Reeves, Trump tariffs, Global trade, UK economy",Faisal Islam & Tom Espiner & Esyllt Carr,2025-04-23T17:01:09.075Z,2025-04-23T17:53:44.126Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9565/live/84c86010-2067-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9565/live/84c86010-2067-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kx1n3xgr2o,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves has signalled the UK could lower tariffs on US car imports as she tries to broker a trade deal with the Trump administration.

Reeves said she wants ""to see tariff and non-tariff barriers reduced between the UK and the US"".

The UK is seeking to lower trade taxes imposed by President Donald Trump of 25% for cars, steel and aluminium and 10% on other British exports.

One of the sticking points for a trade deal in the past has been food standards, but Reeves said the UK would not be reducing these.

Earlier today a document circulated among US business groups and unions seeking views on a potential deal with the UK, focused on lowering UK tariffs on US cars to 2.5% from their current 10%.

The chancellor suggested she was open to this to secure a wider trade deal.

President Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US – including from the UK.

The UK is also facing a broader tariff rate of 10%, and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies – most of which are currently on pause until July.

UK negotiators are working ""flat out"" to get an agreement that is in the country's national interest, Reeves told the BBC at an event in Washington.

""We are willing to reduce trade barriers in the UK, those trade barriers that do exist. And we want to build on the relationship that we have,"" she added later speaking at a Semafor event.

Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a ""good chance"" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.

Speaking to the BBC at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) event on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK was ""not going to rush into a deal"".

But she said the government was ""confident that working with our partners in the US we can get a better trading relationship and build on the substantial trade that already exists between our two great countries"".

""We want to get the right deal for Britain, to better support our industry, our jobs and consumers,"" she added.

Reeves said that the UK had been ""really clear"" in discussions with US negotiators ""that we're not going to be reducing agricultural standards in the UK"".

""The US administration respect and understand that we have high standards to support British farming, and to support British consumers, and we're not going to be relaxing those standards,"" she said.

Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s.

The US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones.

Farmers in the UK warned ministers last week not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in rearing livestock cannot be accepted.

Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would ""expect"" Reeves to stick to agricultural standards ""but let's see the detail as and when there is a deal"".

He said it is ""hugely important"" to ""get these 25% tariffs on cars and steel down"" but he said the government should be moving faster on negotiations.

""It's taken them a long time, in fact, to even have got in the room with the US administration to start discussing these issues, let alone getting a deal now,"" he said.

Trump has brought in a large number of tariffs on imports to the US, arguing they will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs.

These include, as part of an ongoing trade war, levies of up to 145% on Chinese goods. China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.

The move has rattled the world economy, sparking turmoil on global financial markets.

Prices are expected to rise for consumers in the US as a result of the tariffs, due to the companies importing goods passing on higher costs.

The IMF has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty caused by tariffs, and says it expects US growth to be hit the hardest.

On Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK must take the risk of trade wars hitting global economic growth ""very seriously"".

However, Reeves said: ""I do understand the concerns the US has about countries around the world that run large and persistent trade surpluses with the US.""

She said the UK ""is not one of those countries"" so ""there is a deal there to be done between the UK and the US"".

She added that she understood ""the need to rebalance the global economy"".

This, in part, is why the UK announced on Wednesday a review of low-value imports coming into the UK which are ""undercutting the British High Street and British retailers"" she said.

This mirrors a US action, with the White House set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May.

It is set to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.

The removal of the so-called ""de minimis"" rule will hit companies including fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant.

Shein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices ""due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs"".

The UK government said that the UK Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) would be putting more resources into helping firms report unfair trade practices as part of its review.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kx1n3xgr2o
Kemi Badenoch denies rift with Robert Jenrick over Reform comments,"The Tory leader thinks the shadow justice secretary is a ""team player,"" her spokesman tells reporters.",Politics,"Conservative Party, Robert Jenrick, Kemi Badenoch",Brian Wheeler,2025-04-23T16:44:40.210Z,2025-04-23T20:53:29.855Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/727b/live/9609c1e0-205b-11f0-92a1-8d40fc72f60c.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/727b/live/9609c1e0-205b-11f0-92a1-8d40fc72f60c.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lm7rqd4deo,"Kemi Badenoch has rejected claims of a rift with shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick over whether the party should form a pact with Reform UK.

The Conservative leader has always ruled out an electoral pact with Reform UK, arguing that Nigel Farage's party is seeking to destroy the Tories.

In a leaked recordingobtained by Sky News,Jenrick said he wanted the ""fight"" against Labour at the next general election to be ""united"" and he was ""determined"" to ""bring this coalition together"".

Asked about Jenrick's comments on Wednesday, Reform leader Farage told GB News: ""I think my supporters would be revolted.""

The story was seized on by Labour and the Lib Dems, who urged Badenoch to sack her former leadership rival for contradicting her - but her spokesman insisted there were no differences between them.

""Kemi Badenoch has made perfectly clear there will be absolutely no electoral pact with Reform.

""If you actually read the shadow justice secretary's words, he is saying he is working to defeat Reform. The coalition he's talking about is of centre-right voters and bringing them together,"" the spokesman told reporters.

Asked if Badenoch considered Jenrick a ""team player"", the spokesman said: ""Yes, the shadow cabinet is a well-functioning team.""

He said Badenoch had not been aware of Jenrick's comments ahead of them being obtained by Sky, but it was ""demonstrably true"" that the right is not ""united"" and that the Tories needed to get millions of voters back from Reform UK.

And he hit back at claims Badenoch, who beat Jenrick to the Tory crown in a vote of members last November, should ""rein him in"" for writing articles and speeches that went beyond his shadow ministerial brief.

""It is fine for shadow cabinet members and MPs to talk about things that are in the advancement of the Conservative Party,"" he told reporters.

The Tory leader struck a similarly relaxed tone when asked by the BBC if Jenrick was undermining her leadership with his comments on Reform.

""No, not at all,"" she replied.

""I mean we have to be realistic. The Conservatives lost a lot of seats not just because of Labour doing better, but because we lost a lot of votes to Reform so of course we want those voters to come back to us, just as the ones who went to the Lib Dems and Labour we want them to come back to us.""

She added that the party could only tempt voters back with a ""visibly centre-right, authentic Conservative offer"".

Farage was equally unenthusiastic about the potential for a deal with either Jenrick or the Tories, telling GB News: ""I can only deal with people who I could trust. I don't trust them.""

He added: ""We had 14 years of the Conservative party.

""Tax is the highest since 1947, the state growing, the civil service growing, mass immigration at levels even Tony Blair couldn't dream of.

""They let people down by every single measure.""

Earlier, at a fiery Prime Minister's Questions, Badenochattacked Sir Keir Starmer for lacking the ""balls""to say what he really thought about the transgender issue.

The PM hit back, saying no Tory MPs thought she would be the Conservative leader at the next general election.

He added that Jenrick - who was absent from the chamber - was ""away plotting,"" and that he would be left ""fighting over the bones of the Tory party"" with Nigel Farage, who he said would ""eat the Tory party for breakfast"".

In the recording at the centre of the controversy, which was made in March this years at a local Tory event, Jenrick can be heard talking about how Reform UK could make life difficult for his party.

""You head towards a general election, where the nightmare scenario is that Keir Starmer sails in through the middle as a result of the two parties being disunited.

""I don't know about you, but I'm not prepared for that to happen.""

He added: ""I want the fight to be united. And so, one way or another, I'm determined to do that and bring this coalition together and make sure we unite as a nation as well.""

A source close to Jenrick told PA Media on Wednesday that he had no differences with his party leader on ruling out a pact with Reform.

""Rob's comments are about voters and not parties.

""He's clear we have to put Reform out of business and make the Conservatives the natural home for all those on the right, rebuilding the coalition of voters we had in 2019 and can have again.

Proms in the dark: BBC plans an all-nighter at the Royal Albert Hall,"The programme for the 2025 Proms season is unveiled, with a host of special guests... and Traitors.",Culture,"The Proms, Classical music, Music",Mark Savage,2025-04-24T01:11:25.545Z,2025-04-24T01:11:25.545Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/afa1/live/dd580c60-2046-11f0-9411-15ea0745f511.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/afa1/live/dd580c60-2046-11f0-9411-15ea0745f511.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9gllw4dzo,"Organisers of the BBC Proms are encouraging fans to stay up all night, with a ""magical"" and ""intimate"" after-hours concert at the Royal Albert Hall.

Plans for the Dark Till Dawn Prom were unveiled in the programme announcing the summer festival, which will also feature one-handed pianist Nicholas McCarthy, rock star St Vincent and a celebration of film composer Bernard Herrmann.

The ever-popular CBeebies Prom will return, and Claudia Winkelman will host a concert exploring the tense and haunting soundtrack to the hit TV show The Traitors.

Highlights of the classical repertoire include Shoshtakovich's opera Lady Macbeth, and Korean sensation Yunchan Lim playing Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No 4.

On 5 September, Sir Simon Rattle will conduct Chineke! - Europe's first minority Black and ethnically diverse orchestra - for the first time.

Their concert will include a performance of the final work by Pulitzer-winning US composer George Walker, which was written as a response to the2015 Charleston church shooting.

Other stars gracing the 2025 season include soprano of the moment Aigul Akhmetshina, making her Proms debut, violinist Randall Goosby, sitar virtuoso Anoushka Shankar, Pakistani-American singer Arroj Aftab, and Grammy award-winner Angelique Kidjo.

There will be 86 concerts in all, with a number taking place in Gateshead, Bristol, Bradford, Belfast and Sunderland.

Tickets go on sale at 9am on 17 May. On-the-day ""Promming"" tickets are £8 including booking fees, and seated tickets start from £10 plus booking fees.

The all-nighter, on 8 August, is being planned by organist Anna Lapwood, who said the idea had been several years in the making.

""I spend a lot of time at the Albert Hall in the middle of the night, practicing, and I find it fascinating that the building is still just running overnight,"" she says.

""There are always people there - cleaners and security guards - a bit like A Night At The Museum.

""So we talked about how fun it would be to be able to invite people into that space, both physically, but also the abstract space of being in an iconic building in the middle of the night.""

Her programme will include YouTube pianist Hayato Sumino, Russian cellist Anastasia Kobekina and Norwegian ensemble Barroksolistene, whose ""Alehouse sessions"" aim to recreate the atmosphere of a 17th Century English tavern.

Lapwood says the artists are all connected by an enthusiasm for ""messing around"" with music, citing Sumino's viral video of the ""seven degrees of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"".

""There are various moments where we're hoping to do some collaborations,"" she reveals. ""But the logistics of this are all very, very complicated, not least trying to figure out everyone's sleep schedules!""

This summer's season is the first since the departure of Proms director David Pickard. He has been replaced by Hannah Donat who, as director of artistic planning, had shaped the festival alongside the controller of BBC Radio 3, Sam Jackson.

""I think of the Proms as the classical music equivalent of Wimbledon,"" she says.

""Everyone likes to go to Wimbledon, even if they don't watch tennis for the rest of the year; and everyone likes to go to a Prom, even if they're not going to concerts for the rest of the season.""

""It gives the concerts a warmth and an informal atmosphere.

""People don't worry too much about knowing the repertoire inside out - there's just something spectacular about the Albert Hall and seeing the orchestra onstage.""



Among the concerts to watch out for are:

19 July: The Great American Songbook and Beyond with Samara Joy. Fresh from winning best jazz album at this year's Grammys, US singer Samara Joy teams up with the BBC Concert Orchestra for a night of standards by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holliday.

20 July: Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand. The world's only professional one-handed concert pianist, Nicholas McCarthy, makes his Proms debut, playing a concerto originally written for Paul Wittgenstein, after he lost his right arm during World War One.

26 July: The Traitors.""I've asked for a cloak and an owl,"" says Claudia Winkelman, ahead of this one-off concert, featuring classical pieces ""with betrayal at their heart"" alongside the gothic re-workings of pop songs heard in the TV reality show.

2 August: Mahler's Resurrection Symphony. Canadian mezzo-soprano Emily D'Angelo, whose voice has been called ""a thing of wonder"", makes her Proms debut with Norwegian soprano Mari Eriksmoen and the Hallé orchestra.

8 August: 100 Years of the Shipping Forecast. The subtle magic of the Shipping Forecast is celebrated in a special concert, in Belfast's Ulster Hall, featuring Radio 4's continuity announcers and a new work by poet laureate Simon Armitage.

9 August: The Planets and Star Wars.The National Youth Orchestra play two of the world's most recognisable pieces of orchestral music, with an intergalactic theme.

10 August: Edward Gardner Conducts the LPO.Taking a journey through icy waters and cascading waterfalls, the London Philharmonic present a quartet of pieces, including Debussy's La Mer and Sibelius's Oceanides - with an aquatic theme. Electrifying mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina joins in, for her Proms debut.

14 August: Joe Hisaishi and Steve Reich.Legendary Studio Ghibli composer Joe Hisaishi makes his Proms debut conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in two large-scale works exploring themes of destruction and loss - including his piece The End of the World, reflecting the ""anxiety and chaos"" after the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York.

23 August: Mäkelä conducts Mahler's Fifth. Finnish conductor Klaus Mäkelä isn't yet 30, but his electrifying performances have already made headlines around the world. He comes to the Proms with the Dutch Concertgebouw Orchestra, to play Mahler's leonine fifth symphony.

7 September: Angelique Kidjo - African Symphony. ""I want to show the world the richness and beauty of African culture,"" says the Beninese-French music icon Angelique Kidjo of her return to the Proms. Part of Bradford's City of Culture programme, her concert will highlight iconic tracks from legends including Miriam Makeba, Fela Kuti and Youssou N'Dour.

The season concludes with the traditional ""Last Night"" on 13 September, conducted by Elim Chan.

Soprano Louise Alder and trumpeter Alison Balsom will make star turns, alongside the traditional medley of sea shanties, Pomp and Circumstance and Auld Lang Syne.

The concert will also include Donat's favourite ""Easter egg"" for her first year in charge.

""There's a piece of music that I'd wanted to get into the Proms for some time,"" she says, referring to Arthur Benjamin's Storm Cloud Contata.

The music was originally written for Alfred Hitchcock's spy thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1934; and re-arranged by Bernard Herrmann for Hitchcock's Hollywood remake in 1956.

""The final scene takes place in the Albert Hall,"" explains Donat, ""and while Jimmy Stewart's chasing this assassin around the building, Bernard Herrmann is conducting the orchestra on stage - and that's the piece we're including in the Last Night of the Proms.

""It's one of those little winks to the audience that I like to include during the season.""

For those who cannot attend, all of the concerts will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Sounds, and 25 of the nights will be televised.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9gllw4dzo

'My peanut allergy nearly killed me - now I eat them every day',"Just a few years ago, Chris Brookes-Smith could have died from eating peanuts - but taking part in a clinical trial has changed his life.",Health,"Food allergies, Health, Allergies",Philippa Roxby,2025-04-23T23:03:24.765Z,2025-04-23T23:03:24.765Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4915/live/0f5b9600-20e7-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4915/live/0f5b9600-20e7-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpvzrjjdzo,"Chris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut.

Ten years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory.

""I knew I was in trouble after one bite,"" he says. ""Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.""

His voice tails off, full of emotion.

""I thought I was going to die.""

Photos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body.

""I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,"" Chris says.

But the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt ""like boiling water had been poured over me"".

Trying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety.

As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.

An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals.Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious.

Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.

Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day ""on high alert hoping nothing bad happens"".

Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.

Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.

As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.

It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.

Despite being ""really nervous"", Chris agreed to sign up.

Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.

By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.

Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment ""has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives"".

""Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.

""They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.""

The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostlyin childrenwhose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.

""Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,"" says Prof Till. ""Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.""

This trial, published in the journal Allergy,shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.

Chris, who lives in Northamptonshire, had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine.

""The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,"" he says. ""The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.""

But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.

""You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.""

However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.

Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.

""For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,"" explains Prof Till. ""But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.""

Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.

How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.

And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.

Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay – as recommended by his doctors.

He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.

While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into ""nuclear meltdown"" has changed his life.

""It's a wonderful feeling,"" Chris says. ""I'm no longer afraid of dying.""

'People have been eating chocolate digestives wrong for 100 years',The digestive biscuits were originally intended to be eaten with the chocolate side facing down.,Manchester,Stockport,Kaya Black,2025-04-24T05:16:55.977Z,2025-04-24T13:17:54.630Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/02ec/live/ac2b75c0-20ee-11f0-8451-0101bb35273b.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/02ec/live/ac2b75c0-20ee-11f0-8451-0101bb35273b.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0zdelrdgzo,"The boss of the biscuits factory where McVitie's chocolate digestives have been made for the last 100 years reckons people have always eaten them incorrectly.

Anthony Coulson, general manager at the company's chocolate refinery and bakery in Stockport, said the teatime staple was originally meant to be eaten with the chocolate-covered side facing down.

""It's the world's most incredible debate, whether you have the chocolate on the top or the chocolate on the bottom,"" mused Mr Coulson, who admitted he was a chocolate-on-top man.

The factory opened in 1917, with the chocolate digestive launched eight years later.

About 80 million packets are made every year, with all of the chocolate made in Greater Manchester.

Mr Coulson toldBBC Radio Manchester: ""One of the very first things I learnt when I  got to join McVitie's was chocolate side down to eat the digestive.

""Now up until then I'd always eaten it the other way round...You can do it exactly how you want to do it.""

Mr Coulson said the theory was ""it starts to melt, you start to get the flavour and away you go"", adding: ""It makes sense, right?""

The chocolate digestive was launched about a quarter of a century after the plain variety, whose name was inspired by the belief that the baking powder in the recipe would help with digestion.

Its creation came two years before one of the food manufacturer's other famous brands, the Jaffa Cake, which itself has becomesomething of a confectionery conundrum.

And although people might think of the chocolate digestive as being topped with chocolate, the company has said that as the plain biscuits pass through a ""chocolate reservoir"", the chocolate actually coats the underside of it.

Lynn Loftus, who has worked at the factory for 36 years, called the biscuit ""timeless"", adding that she thought it would be around for many years to come.

Craig Leech, who has worked at McVitie's for 21 years, started off in the factory by putting the chocolate on top of the biscuits.

""I just come in with a positive attitude. I know the people and the products inside out,"" said Mr Leech, who is now a planning manager for the refinery.

Alix Knagg, who has been working there for six months, said the chocolate digestive was ""still a great product 100 years on"".

Paddington musical: McFly's Tom Fletcher reveals details of new stage show,"The McFly star says he is ""so lucky and honoured"" to have written the music and lyrics for the new show.",Culture,"Theatre, Film, Paddington Bear",Steven McIntosh,2025-04-24T04:57:52.015Z,2025-04-24T04:57:52.015Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b329/live/01b69810-2033-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b329/live/01b69810-2033-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c793l125gwvo,"McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt ""overwhelming excitement"" working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November.

The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would ""do Paddington proud"", adding that the musical numbers are ""my favourite songs I've ever written"".

The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.

The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.

Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt ""so honoured and lucky"" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect ""all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly"".

""There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,"" he joked.

Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.

He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the showwas formally announced in 2023.

With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature ""lots of juicy new material"".

""We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,"" she said.

""Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.""

Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.

The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.

Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what ""the musical language"" of Paddington was. ""Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,"" he explained.

He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with ""a very fast 'yes please'"", but began writing music for the show right away.

""While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.""

He reflected: ""My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.""

The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.

In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.

It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.

""I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!"" joked Swale. ""He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!""

She continued: ""I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.""



Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for ""really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it”, adding: “Every single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.

""I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.""

As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical ""also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington"".

""For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.""

Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be ""fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right"".

He added: ""I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.""

The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, ""so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in"", he explained.

""It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.""

Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.

""You can rest easy,"" laughed Swale. ""Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c793l125gwvo

Cardinal Vincent Nichols will vote with more than 100 others, but almost missed out, as he is only a few months off his 80th birthday, the age limit for voting rights.

The Merseyside-born Archbishop of Westminster said he thought it would ""pass me by"" until he heard the Pope was seriously ill and thought: ""Oh Lord, this is going to come my way.""

The conclave, which traditionally starts after a two-week mourning period, sees the College of Cardinals gather in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel to cast a series of votes to choose the next pope.

Theoretically, any baptised man can be elected as pope, but a cardinal is usually picked.

There are currently 252 cardinals and while all can take part in the debate about who should be chosen, the voting age restriction means only the 135 who are under 80 can vote.

Cardinal Nichols, who leads six million Roman Catholics in England and Wales, exclusively told BBC North West he ""never thought"" he would be voting because Pope Francis ""didn't show many signs of slowing down"" and appeared to be recovering from double pneumonia.

However, he played down any suggestion of remaining in the Vatican as the next pope himself.

""I'm coming home,"" he said.

""You can be sure of that.""

The 79-year-old archbishop, who was born in Crosby on the Merseyside coast, said he had met Pope Francis several times during high-level meetings in Rome, but had two abiding special memories.

""One particularly has never left me,"" he said.

""He said to me: 'From the moment of my election as Pope, my peace has never left me'.

""Despite the pressure of all he has to deal with, he has lived close to God.""

Cardinal Nichols also said he had fond memories of their last meeting two years ago.

He said an author had asked him to give a copy of their latest book to Pope Francis.

""I gave him the book and said the author was 'very keen that you might have this',"" he said.

""He came back after lunch with a handwritten card and a copy of one of his own books for me to give as a return gift.

""That was quite astonishing.""

Following Pope Francis's funeral on Saturday, Cardinal Nichols will join his fellow cardinals to vote for the 267th pontiff, who will go on to lead the world's estimated 1.4 billion Catholics.

He said the prospect was ""quite intimidating frankly"".

He added that he believed the cardinals would their ""best work once the doors of the conclave have been shut"", as at that point, there would be ""a peace and a prayerfulness between us"".

""I know I have got to get myself together and be a little nuanced to all the political manoeuvring and Paddy Power's bets and all that and say 'actually, this is a group of men trying to discern the will of God,"" he said.

""That's the only thing that matters.""

How Northamptonshire became a warehouse and 'mega sheds' capital,"Real estate experts say online shopping is driving demand for more, and often larger, warehouses.",England,"Corby, Retailing, Logistics",Jon Ironmonger,2025-04-24T04:29:16.273Z,2025-04-24T04:29:16.273Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8b08/live/b2e38930-1ba7-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8b08/live/b2e38930-1ba7-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewg415g0kgo,"Bang in the middle of England, Northamptonshire has more storage and distribution centres than anywhere else in the country.

Corby, for example, is home to dozens of towering ""mega-sheds"", including Europa's worldwide HQ and Nike's forthcoming logistics campus.

But real estate experts say the current crop is just the start, and the UK will need the equivalent of more than 2,000 football pitches of extra warehouse space to keep up with house-building targets and the growth of online retail.

The head of the UK Warehousing Association insisted warehouses were an ""important engine of growth"" and said several recent constructions near to people's home were the result of a ""broken planning system"".

Speak to people in Corby town centre about warehouses and a theme soon emerges.

""I think they're disgusting,"" one woman said, ""an eyesore - I know we need them, but people have got their houses right next door.""

""We've got enough now"" another woman tells me, ""put them somewhere else.""

That may be wishful thinking.



Will Laing, a research analyst at Newmark Group, a specialist in commercial real estate, said warehouses in Northamptonshire are likely to keep getting bigger, as occupiers seek to expand and improve performance.

""We are seeing trade flows from the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk increase significantly, and these trade flows naturally go into the golden logistics triangle (an area of the East Midlands).

""Having a larger warehouse there allows for occupiers to reach the vast majority of consumers, and provides a central base for their other logistics networks.""

More homes mean more warehouses on the horizon, he said.

""On average, 69 sq ft (6.4 sq m) of warehouse space is needed to service each new home,"" said Mr Laing.

""Given the government's target to build 1.5 million homes in the next five years, coupled with the continued shift to online retail, we estimate 150,000,000 sq ft (13,935,456 sq m) of extra warehousing will be needed over the next 10 years.""

That's the equivalent of 2,160 football pitches, or about 1,500 large warehouses measuring 100,000 sq ft (9,290 sq m).

The warehouse-dotted landscape in Northamptonshire has provoked anger from some communities.

There have been thousands of objections to a proposed distribution siteon farmland near Thrapstonand a recently approved DHL logistics hubon the outskirts of Towcester.

Elsewhere, in Corby, those opposed to living in the shadow of an 18m (59ft) warehouse on the site of the former Weetabix plant wererecently refused a judicial review.

However, a judge said the council had ""fallen well below the standard expected"" by failing to consult residents properly after distributing notices to the wrong street.

The warehouse in question, Rockingham 161, is currently vacant and taking bids from occupiers with the promise of bringing hundreds of jobs to the local area.

It'sa similar story for villagers in Nactonnear Ipswich, who told the BBC a ""mega-shed"" near their homes, the size of six football pitches, had brought them to tears.

Neighbours have described the warehouse as a ""monstrosity"" and ""the wrong development, in the wrong location"".

But not everyone agrees warehouses are an eyesore.

""I love them"" says Clare Bottle, chief executive ofthe UK Warehousing Association.

""If I had one at the bottom of my garden, I would genuinely not be disappointed, because I think they look majestic and wonderful.

""But there is a bigger story here, because poorly located warehouses are a symptom of our broken planning system.

""Those areas with warehouses near homes in Corby and Nacton have been nominated as industrial land, so it's easier to get planning permission, and we're finding in East Anglia there just isn't enough industrial land.""

However, that could soon change undergovernment reforms to planning policy, which are the subject of a public consultation.

The measures would allow more areas of the green belt to be defined as grey belt, making them suitable for commercial development.

Ministers insist logistics is one of the key industries the reforms will aim to support.

""We're not building warehouses for the sake of it,"" Mrs Bottle said. ""We're building them because they're an important engine of growth in our supply chains these days, and that's good for everyone.

""We're more reliant on the service sector than ever before, and we're relying on goods being as close to the supply chain as possible.""

Despite public objections to more warehousing, the industry has been growing largely due to a shift in people's spending habits.

Official figuresshow internet sales as a percentage of total retail has risen steadily over the past 20 years and now stands at about 27%, with consumers expecting ever quicker deliveries or returns.

Clare Newton, commercial director atWarehouse Space, a storage rental service, says people need to get used to warehouses.

""What human beings have got to appreciate is if they're buying stuff online and want it tomorrow, then guess what, it's going to a warehouse near you.

""Eight per cent of the UK population is employed in logistics, and all of them are running around to make people's lives cheaper and easier.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewg415g0kgo
Turner Prize nominates neurodiverse and refugee artists,The four artists in the running for this year's prestigious art award are revealed.,Culture,"Turner Prize, Art, Tate art galleries",Paul Glynn,2025-04-23T10:56:46.067Z,2025-04-23T10:56:46.067Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/25bc/live/5896c400-2030-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/25bc/live/5896c400-2030-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c705knpw4r8o,"A learning disabled artist, a former Iraqi refugee and one of the youngest ever nominees are among the artists shortlisted for this year's Turner Prize.

Nnena Kalu, Mohammed Sami, Zadie Xa and Rene Matić - who at 27 is the second youngest artist to be nominated after Damien Hirst - are all in the running for the prestigious annual art prize, the Tate announced on Wednesday.

An exhibition of their work will be held at the Cartwright Hall Art Gallery from September as part of Bradford's UK City of Culture celebrations.

The winner, who will be awarded £25,000, will then be announced on 9 December at a ceremony in the West Yorkshire city.

Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain and chair of the Turner Prize jury, said the shortlist ""reflects the breadth of artistic practice today, from painting and sculpture to photography and installation"".

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the artists, who are each guaranteed to receive £10,000, offer ""extraordinary world-views that are very personal"".

Take a closer look at all four shortlisted artists and their work:

Glasgow-bornNnena Kalu(above), who has limited verbal communication, has been a resident artist with Action Space, which supports artists with learning disabilities, for more than 25 years.

She creates large-scale swirling abstract drawings and sculpures made from colourful streams of repurposed fabrics and materials such as reels of VHS tape.

The jury praised her ""unique command of material, colour and gesture and her highly attuned responses to architectural space"".

Photographer, writer and poetRene Matić, from Peterborough, is nominated for their solo exhibition, As Opposed To The Truth, at CCA Berlin, which touches on the rise of right-wing populism and identities.

Matić captures ""fleeting moments of joy in daily life, and expressions of tenderness within a wider political context"", according to Tate, using intimate photos of family and friends placed in an installation which also includes objects like the artist's collection of black baby dolls salvaged from second-hand shops.

The work looks at themes including ""the constructed self through the lens of rudeness"" and rudeboy culture, a Jamaican subculture.

The jury said they were ""struck by the artist's ability to express concerns around belonging and identity"".

Mohammed Samihails from Baghdad and his work draws on his life and experiences during the Iraq war and as a refugee in Sweden.

The artist is recognised for solo exhibition After the Storm at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, and the jury were impressed by his ""powerful representation"" of war and exile.

His large-scale paintings explore memory and loss, layering patterns and colours to create ""haunting, dreamlike scenes"".

Zadie Xacomes from Vancouver, Canada, and her work is inspired by her Korean heritage and the importance of shamanic beliefs.

Interweaving paintings, murals, traditional patchwork textiles and 650 brass bells that make harmonised sounds inspired by Korean shamanic ritual bells, Xa's art focuses on the sea as ""a spiritual realm to explore traditions and folklore, speaking to a multitude of cultures"".

The jury felt the ""vibrant installation"" was a ""sophisticated development"" of her work.

Established in 1984, the prize is named after radical painter JMW Turner -who would have turned 250 on Wednesday- and is awarded each year to a British-based  artist for an ""outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work"".

Shanaz Gulzar, creative director Bradford UK City of Culture 2025, said it was ""a huge honour and privilege"" to bring the prize tothe city that gave the world David Hockney.

""Bradford has produced some amazing artists, literary artists, visual artists, contemporary artists,"" she told Radio 4.

""And to have these four artists in Bradford, I think really speaks to how we're delivering our year so far, and it speaks to our audiences.""

Last year's prize was won by Jasleen Kaur, who used a vintage Ford Escort, worship bells and Irn-Bru to celebrate the Scottish Sikh community.

Other ther previous winners have included Sir Anish Kapoor (1991), Damien Hirst (1995) and Sir Steve McQueen (1999).",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c705knpw4r8o
Letter reveals William Shakespeare did not abandon his wife,New analysis of a letter suggests that the couple's relationship was closer than previously thought.,England,"Stratford-upon-Avon, William Shakespeare, London, University of Bristol, Bristol",James Diamond,2025-04-23T11:36:20.587Z,2025-04-23T11:36:20.587Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7514/live/103cfe20-205f-11f0-bfaa-ab0539d45dd3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7514/live/103cfe20-205f-11f0-bfaa-ab0539d45dd3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygregz439o,"The relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife Anne Hathaway may have been happier than previously thought, according to new research.

For more than 200 years it has been believed that Shakespeare left his wife in Stratford-upon-Avon when he travelled to London and that a decision to leave her almost nothing in his will meant he probably felt bitterness towards her.

However, examination of a fragment of a letter, which is addressed to ""good Mrs Shakespeare"", appears to show they did live together in central London between 1600-1610.

The research was carried out by Prof Matthew Steggle from the University of Bristol's Department of English.

In the letter, which was preserved by accident in the binding of a book in Hereford, it is alleged that Shakespeare is withholding money from an orphan boy named John Butts, with the letter asking Mrs Shakespeare for money instead.

Prof Steggle said: ""First discovered in 1978, the letter's been known for a while, but no-one could identify the names or places involved or see any reason to think that the Mr Shakespeare in the letter was necessarily William rather than anyone else of the same name in the general period.

""So, it's a story about the Shakespeares' marriage, really, as well as about Shakespeare's London contacts.

""And if the writing on the back of the letter is a reply, then it's also a story about the first ever bit of writing which can be attributed to Anne Hathaway.""

The letter refers to the boy being a fatherless apprentice and through his research Prof Steggle says there was only one person in London called John Butts who fits that criterion.

The letter also refers to a Trinity Lane and of the four married couples called Shakspaire (spelling of the time) known to be in London in that period, only William and Anne are likely to have lived in that area.

""It at least doubles the number of letters known to be addressed to or sent from Shakespeare and his family,"" Prof Steggle said.

""Currently, there's only one known. It also shows a side of Shakespeare's London life that's not been known before, giving him a new address in Trinity Lane and a whole new sphere of activity for him.""

Prof Steggle said it ""opens the door"" to the idea Shakespeare's wife did indeed spend ""significant"" time with her husband in London.

""It's not a complete slam dunk,"" he told the BBC.

""It's a possibility that seems difficult to avoid, rather than a certainty.""



Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, author Maggie O'Farrell, whose book Hamnet is a fictionalised account of the marriage between Shakespeare and his wife as they deal with the loss of their son, called the discovery ""thrilling"" and ""wonderful"".

""There have been very respected scholars who've said that she was ugly, that Shakespeare hated her, that she trapped him into marriage, that she was illiterate, that she was stupid,"" Ms O'Farrell said.

""There is absolutely not one shred of evidence for any of that and it's always baffled me as to why she attracts all this vilification and all this misogyny.

""And it's so wonderful to find this tiny fragment of a letter which was discovered in the binding of a book that was published in 1608, that proves of course that they did love each other and probably lived together for some time in London.""

Louisa Palmisano: The fatal van crash that left a city horrified,Three-year-old Louisa Palmisano was struck and killed as she walked with her parents in Manchester.,England,"Manchester, Burnley",Ewan Gawne,2025-04-23T05:19:53.222Z,2025-04-23T05:19:53.222Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/62d6/live/be422510-1f86-11f0-acbf-41bf5b8e34ef.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/62d6/live/be422510-1f86-11f0-acbf-41bf5b8e34ef.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9j2py1zgo,"A family's trip out one sunny day in Manchester became an ""unimaginable tragedy"" for the parents of three-year-old Louisa Palmisano, who was killed when she was hit by a van.

The driver, 35-year-old Rawal Rehman, haspleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous drivingafter he struck the child, known as Lulu, on Saturday 22 February.

A court heard he had taken ""20 lines of cocaine"" when he first crashed into a tram before his van was forced on to the pavement where the child, from Burnley in Lancashire, was walking hand-in-hand with her parents.

Rehman flagged down a taxi to escape the scene, leading to a police manhunt before he was arrested two days later.

Lulu's parents had taken their daughter to the city for the weekend and were walking first along Booth Street.

At about 10:00 BST, Lulu was hit after the van crashed into the tram on Mosely Street, close to Manchester Art Gallery.

The tram had no time to react as Rehman had ignored the stop and warning signs and driven straight into the oncoming vehicle, according to the Crown Prosecution Service.

Rehman's car then mounted the pavement and struck the girl, who was given emergency treatment as a junior doctor and other passers-by ran to help.

Lulu was taken to Manchester Royal Infirmary but her severe injuries, which included major head trauma, were too much for her to survive.

Lulu was described in a tribute by her parents as the ""sweetest, kindest, and most generous little girl"", who was full of creativity and joy, and ""absolutely loved going to nursery every day"".

They said ""The pain of losing her is unbearable and we miss her more than words can ever express.""

Rehman fled the scene of the crash and was arrested by Greater Manchester Police two days later on Monday  24 February.

He was later charged with causing death by dangerous driving, and on Tuesday pleaded guilty to the offence.

In the aftermath, a Manchester City Council spokesman said the incident left ""all of Manchester horrified"".

Lulu's parents said: ""In an instant, our lives were shattered beyond repair.

""Her absence has left a devastating void in our family. She was our only child, our whole world.""

Iain Packer was convicted last year of killing the 27-year-old sex worker in woods in South Lanarkshire - 19 years after he was first identified as a suspect.

The Scottish government ordered a judge-led public inquiry into the original police investigation into Emma's death in May 2005.

Lord Scott was a prominent human rights lawyer before he became a judge in 2022.

In February last year Packer wasconvicted of offences against a total of 22 women, including 11 rapes.

He was first interviewed by detectives a month after Emma's body was found.

However, 19 years passed before Packer faced justice, and hesexually assaulted multiple womenin the intervening years.

Former detectives involved in the inquirytold BBC Scotland Newsthat senior officers told them not to pursue Packer as a suspect, and to instead focus on building a case against four Turkish men.

The family of Ms Caldwell previously called for a judge from outside Scotland to chair the public inquiry.

But speaking outside the Scottish parliament, Margaret Caldwell, Emma's mother, backed the appointment of Lord Scott to lead the inquiry.

She said: ""I'm happy with this decision - I'm hoping things will get going now.

""We've waited a long long time and there's no closure as far as I'm concerned. I just have to live with everything.""

Mrs Caldwell's solicitor Aamer Anwar added: ""Lord Scott is respected for his formidable reputation in fighting for human rights prior to being appointed a Scottish judge.

""The family wanted a judge who could be trusted to act without fear or favour and shine a glaring spotlight into the heart of policing and the crown office in Scotland.

""Margaret Caldwell hopes that Lord Scott will be that judge.""

Justice secretary Angela Constance said the inquiry would ""provide answers to the victims and survivors involved and ensure that lessons are learned for the future"".

She added: ""The other victims, as well as Emma's mother Margaret and the rest of the family, deserve nothing less after the unbearable loss, pain and grief they have suffered.

""Lord Scott has a strong track record on human rights and I am pleased that someone of his experience, expertise and legal standing will lead this inquiry.

""Importantly, Emma's family support his appointment.""

Lord Scott chaired the Scottish Human Rights Centre from 1997 to 2005 and has previously led a number of reviews of policing powers.

He said: ""I am aware of the significant public interest in this inquiry and the importance it holds for Emma Caldwell's family.

"Dentists remove over 50,000 NHS patients from practice lists","Out of the 360 dental practices in Northern Ireland, only two are now fully NHS.",Northern Ireland,"Dentistry, Dungiven, Northern Ireland, NHS, Ballymoney",BBC NI Health Unit,2025-04-24T05:43:11.728Z,2025-04-24T05:43:11.728Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e42a/live/1f6611d0-2054-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e42a/live/1f6611d0-2054-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrg68633y2o,"Dentists in Northern Ireland have removed more than 53,000 NHS patients from their practice lists over the past two years, BBC News NI has learned.

During 2023 and 2024, 114 dentists handed back their NHS contracts to the Department of Health (DoH), with many of these now doing private work only.

Out of the 360 dental practices in Northern Ireland, only two are now fully NHS.

Peter Corkish said he was shocked to get a letter three weeks ago to sign up to a private plan from their dentist: ""My wife has rung numerous dentists and everybody's saying the same, that they're only taking on private patients.""

Figures obtained by BBC News NI show that in 2023, dentists removed 12,924 NHS patients from their practices – but that figure reached 40,980 last year.

The figures also revealed that up to January this year, there were 192,780 fewer patients registered with a dentist.

That figure includes ""lapsed"" patients who have not attended their dentist for some time, and have fallen off the registration list.

Some patients have been offered the chance to sign up to private dental payment plans, which cover basic check-ups and cleaning, with charges for extra treatments depending on the amount of money they have to pay in each month.

Mr Corkish, from Ballymoney, County Antrim, said he and his wife had tried to find other NHS dentists in their town and in nearby Coleraine and Ballymena but have had no luck.

""It said that as of 1 July, the dental practice we're with is no longer offering that National Health Service and we're being given the option if we want to stay with them, to either obtain a dental plan or to just register as a normal private patient,"" he explained.

""Nobody's catering for National Health Service (patients) anymore.

""There's one question I would like to put to local politicians and MPs and ask them is this the end of national health dental treatment within Northern Ireland?""

Kegan Lewis has the only dental practice in Dungiven, County Londonderry.

It is a predominantly health service practice with about 95% of its 4,500 to 5,000 patients receiving NHS treatment.

Ms Lewis said she faces ""huge demand"" from patients wishing to register with an NHS practice as ""more and more practices leave the health service"", but her surgery is at capacity.

She said that if her practice can no longer provide NHS dental care, there will be ""vulnerable groups"" unable to access a dentist.

Ms Lewis said NHS dentistry is a ""highly regulated service"" which follows a ""high-volume, low margin model"".

""It's a professional service and that does create a cost burden for a dental practice to operate,"" she said.

""The fees are set by the Department of Health, but increasingly, these fees just don't cover the cost of being open and providing service to our patients.""

One of Ms Lewis's patients, Dorothy Hegarty, said she would ""prefer to rely on the NHS rather than go privately"".

""I just think it's very expensive and probably unnecessarily expensive,"" she said.

""People who have low income... shouldn't have to wait longer than the likes of me that maybe could go privately if I wanted to or had to.""

Mrs Hegarty said if her dentist closed in Dungiven it would be ""quite serious"" and have a ""major impact"" on a lot of people.

The dentists' union - the British Dental Association (BDA) - has warned there may be further erosion of NHS services as the cost of delivering them means many dental practices are becoming financially unviable.

The DoH has been in a stand-off with the BDA over reforming the payments made to dentists.

Last year, the department said £9m was to be invested in dental services in Northern Ireland.

However, the BDA says that falls short of what is required and is calling for further reform.

Dr Ciara Gallagher, chair of the BDA's Northern Ireland committee, said the set-up and running costs dentists are facing are ""astronomical"" and the DoH's payments do not reflect these.

""You're in an impossible situation where you have to choose between accepting a patient who needs care or the viability of your business,"" she said.

Dr Gallagher said the Health MinisterMike Nesbitt's pledge for reform by 2027was welcome but did not deal with the current problems.

Patients with urgent dental problems can be treated under the Dental Access Scheme, which was set up for unregistered patients, asylum seekers and refugees.

There are 34 practices signed up to the scheme - which represents less than 10% of Northern Ireland dental practices.

The BBC has made several requests for an interview with Northern Ireland's Chief Dental Officer, Caroline Lappin, but she was not made available.

In a statement, the DoH said the decrease in registered patients was down to people falling off dentists' lists because of not having attended for two years and practices not registering new patients.

It said dentists were under no obligation to register health service patients.

There had been investment in dental access schemes, which had also led to almost 34,000 children becoming registered with a dentists since June 2024, it said.

The department added that a review of dental services was under way, but said the budget allocated ""is not sufficient to meet the needs of the current service, let alone introduce the kind of transformative change that is needed"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrg68633y2o

He said: ""We were sat down to have dinner around 19:20 last night when we heard a tremendous bang. The kind of bang where you know something serious has happened.

""We came outside to the road, a couple of vehicles obviously had a big collision, one of them was on fire.""

He said he and a neighbour approached the burning car and saw the driver was still inside.

""We made the decision to get him out, because there was obviously danger with the fire... within two minutes, the whole vehicle was in a ball of flames.""

Mr Johnson said the location of the collision was on ""a nasty blind bend"" which was prone to accidents, but not ""as bad as this one"".

Scott Davidson, on whose property the accident partly happened, was out when it happened but said the scene was ""horrendous"" when he returned.

""One car was on fire and the paramedics, ambulance, police - there must have been 20 or 30 people treating the guys in the accident,"" he said.

""The car on fire was in the main road on the opposite side, one of the cars has come through our fence onto our property.""

The road was cleared and reopened on Thursday morning, but the aftermath of the collision could clearly be seen.

Debris and small parts of vehicles were visible on the same side of the road as the now-closed Downing Arms Inn.

The collision happened in a 40mph zone just before the road changes to 60mph as you leave the village.

A wooden fence of a nearby property was damaged as well as nearby trees and bushes.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82wr1pdzpo

Leah Harrison, a Year 6 pupil at Mount Pleasant Primary School in Darlington, died in May last year during a residential trip to Carlton Adventure in Carlton-in-Cleveland, on the edge of the North York Moors National Park.

At the start of the inquest at Teesside Magistrates' Court, senior activities co-ordinator Paul Godwin said Leah was with a group of children taking part in a forest walk.

He said the weather ""did not cause me any concern for Leah's group"", although conditions were misty.

Mr Godwin said the risk of a mudslide was ""totally unforeseen"" and would not have been included in a risk assessment because there was ""no prior indication"" of such an event.

He said he was supervising another activity at the centre when he was informed of what had happened.

The inquest jury also heard a written statement from Leah's mother, Michelle Harrison.

She said Leah was a ""happy-go-lucky person with a gorgeous, infectious smile"".

Ms Harrison said although Leah had recently been poorly with tonsillitis she was looking forward to the trip to the adventure centre.

She said she was ""proud as punch"" to be on the trip.

In a statement read to the inquest jury, Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton said Leah died from ""traumatic asphyxia"", but had ""no natural disease"".

A two month investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) concluded last December that no one was at fault.

The mudslide, at the Hartlepool Borough Council-owned site, happened while a Met Office yellow weather warning for heavy rain was in place.

Headteacher Joanne Blackham, who was on the activity trip, said Leah had ""really impressed her in the activities"" and ""pushed herself out of her comfort zone"".

When reading a  statement she had previously made to the police, she became emotional as she described the mud slide being like a ""lava flow"".

With mud up to her chest, Ms Blackburn tried to pull Leah out by her legs but ""there was no movement"".

She said she had had no concerns previously about the weather conditions, describing it as ""just a rainy day"".

""It literally just came out of nowhere, you could hear the roaring and rushing of water and muck.

""It just swept her away - it just took her.""

The inquest, which is expected to last up to two days, continues.

Patriotism surges in Quebec before election as Trump rattles Canada,The US president’s threats have even separatists speaking of unity - and that impact who wins Monday's national election.,US & Canada,"Quebec, Canada election 2025, Canada",Jessica Murphy,2025-04-24T00:31:30.414Z,2025-04-24T00:31:30.414Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ed2b/live/48f378d0-209f-11f0-a4a0-078cb429eb10.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ed2b/live/48f378d0-209f-11f0-a4a0-078cb429eb10.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98576z8ln8o,"In Quebec, the issue of independence from Canada has long simmered. But faced with US tariffs and President Donald Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st US state, many voters are now seeking unity.

Suzanne Dumont knows who she will vote for in Canada's election, though it's a decision made ""not from my heart, it's from my head"".

The 70-year-old from Quebec City considers herself a sovereigntist, but hopes when Canadians go to the polls on Monday they'll elect a majority government to take on Trump.

The Bloc Québécois, a federal party that supports independence and only runs candidates in the predominantly French-speaking province, can't deliver on that, she says.

Supporting the Conservatives is ""unthinkable"" to Ms Dumont, so this time she will be voting Liberal.

In Montreal, Louis Plouffe is picking up groceries at the city's Jean-Talon market.

He tells the BBC that he thinks the Bloc ""defends Quebec's interests well"" as an opposition party in Parliament. Still, ""it's not being in power"", the 65-year-old says, and he wants a government with a strong mandate ""ready for the wave that's coming"" from the US.

And while Mr Plouffe has reservations about the Liberal leader, he believes Mark Carney has come across as credible and confident in interviews. He too will vote for the party.

""Canadian patriotism is on the rise in Quebec"", said Émilie Foster, an adjunct professor in politics at Carleton University. ""We prefer to be part of Canada instead of being part of the United States, if we have to choose,"" she says.

Sébastien Dallaire, a pollster with Léger, puts it this way: ""It's hard to say now is the time to talk about Quebec sovereignty, or now is the time to do things specifically to defend Quebec, when clearly there's a national crisis and everybody is staring not at Ottawa as the adversary, but as Washington as the clear opponent.""

A recent Léger survey suggests that almost 40% of voters for the Bloc believe an independent Quebec would have less influence than Canada as a whole in dealing with the US.

The Liberals are currently polling at about 46% in the province, with the Bloc a distant second at 25%, slightly ahead of the Conservatives, who have long struggled to gain real traction there.

Quebec can be a wildcard in general elections, and winning the province - which holds 78 seats of the 343 in the House of Commons - can propel a party to power.

The abandonment of smaller parties - like the Bloc, the left-leaning New Democrats or the Green Party - is a trend seen nationwide as Canadians rally around either the Liberals or the Conservatives in the face of a new threat from their neighbour.

Carney, a former central banker for Canada and the UK, is seeking to paint himself as the leader most able to help the country navigate the crisis. Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is billing himself as the change candidate who can restore the ""Canadian promise"".

It has been a remarkable election campaign, one sparked by the resignation of longtime Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and then overshadowed by an unprecedented intervention from an American president which transformed the state of the race.

Trump's tariffs are expected to hit Quebec especially hard. The province is one of the biggest suppliers to the US of aluminium, a sector hit by Trump's 25% tariffs. Its significant forestry and dairy industries are also in the president's sights.

Quebec also fiercely protects its identity and its culture as a distinct society, and has twice held referendums on whether to seek independence from the rest of Canada. That's why the US president's repeated digs at Canada's sovereignty has sparked such disquiet here.

Bloc MP Louis-Philippe Sauvé, a former political aide, is fighting to hold on to the seat he won just last September in a special election in the southwest Montreal riding of LaSalle-Émard-Verdun - an upset victory in a district considered a Liberal stronghold.

The riding is historically working-class, and in recent years parts have become some of the trendiest in the city.

Gentrification has brought pressures, and Sauvé tells the BBC during a pause while campaigning that issues like housing, homelessness and immigration all come up as he goes door-knocking, just as they did six months ago.

""That's all still there, but for sure this general election is very much monopolised by challenges posed by the US, the Canada-US relationship,"" he says. ""That's really what everyone's talking about.""

He admits some frustration that it's become the ""ballot box question"".

""Trump won't be president of the United States for eternity,"" he adds. ""The housing crisis will still be a problem in the next few years.""

The Bloc's struggles come despite a consensus that party leader Yves-François Blanchet hasn't had many stumbles in the campaign.

His pitch is that the party can be a check on federal powers, warning that Ottawa might sell out provincial interests if push comes to shove in trade and security talks with the US, which are expected to launch shortly after the 28 April election.

And in a number of ways, Carney is also an unusual choice for Quebec voters. Born in western Canada, his French can be shaky - usually a political liability in the province.

Even Trudeau, widely viewed as bilingual,faced scrutinyover his linguistic abilities. Carney has given his own French a six out of 10. Ms Dumont said she would ""never"" rate him that high.

Carney has also come out against sensitive issues for many Quebecers, including saying that a Liberal government would intervene if a bill that expands French-language requirements in the province were challenged at the Supreme Court.

""I have a hard time explaining the lack of reaction by Quebecers,"" says Bloc MP Sauvé of Carney's enduring popularity in the province. ""It's like there is a Teflon effect.""



The Liberal candidate in the riding, Claude Guay - the former CEO of IBM Canada who is taking his first run at politics - says Quebecers have taken notice of things like Trump signing an executive order making English America's official language. (French is Quebec's official language, while Canada is officially bilingual.)

""The threat of the 51st state, for example, really impacts the opinions of people that may have been sovereigntist and they're thinking: 'Well, do we have a better place in Canada?'"" he says.

Still, no one suggests that the issue of Quebec sovereignty has been settled. About 30% of Quebecers currently back independence even as some are opting to vote with the Liberals this election.

For Mr Plouffe, the shopper at the Montreal market, however, now is just not the time to take the leap.

""It's not saying it won't happen, and I won't say I won't support it. But we're not ready,"" he says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98576z8ln8o

Trump attacks Zelensky over possibility of Crimea going to Russia,"The Ukrainian president has consistently rejected the suggestion that his country give up its claim to the Crimean Peninsula.

Writing on Truth Social, Trump claimed a deal to end the war was ""very close"", but that Zelensky's refusal to accept US terms ""will do nothing but prolong"" the conflict.

Earlier, US Vice-President JD Vance laid out the US vision for a deal, saying it would ""freeze the territorial lines [...] close to where they are today"".

Ukraine has long said it will not give up Crimea, a southern peninsula illegally annexed by Russia in 2014.

Vance said the deal would mean Ukraine and Russia ""are both going to have to give up some of the territory they currently own"".

The administration has yet to publicly offer specifics about what geographic concessions would have to be made.

When asked by reporters at the White House about whether the administration was looking to recognise Russia's sovereignty over Crimea, Trump said he just wanted to see the war end.

""I have no favourites. I don't want to have any favourites. I want to have a deal done,"" he said.

Recognising Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea would not only be politically impossible for Zelensky to accept, it would also be contrary to post-war international legal norms that borders should not be changed by force.

He has consistently rejected the suggestion that his country give up its claim to the Crimean Peninsula.

""There's nothing to talk about here. This is against our constitution,"" he said.

Overnight, Ukraine reported a Russian missile and drone attack on several regions.

In the capital Kyiv, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said two people were killed and 54 injured, including children and a pregnant woman. Drone wreckage triggered several fires,  and a number of people were trapped under the rubble of a residential building, he said.

In Kharkiv, in the north-east, blasts were reported in the city.

Nine people were earlier killedand dozens more wounded in the eastern Ukrainian city of Marhanets when a Russian drone hit a bus carrying workers.

The back-and-forth comments from Trump and Zelensky are the latest chapter in an often fractious relationship.

In February, the pairclashed in a fiery meeting in the Oval Office.

Trump said on Wednesday in the Oval Office that he found it easier to deal with Russia compared to Ukraine.

""I think Russia is ready,"" Trump said, noting he believed they were nearing a deal with the Kremlin but aren't there with Ukraine. ""I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelensky. So far, it's been harder.""

He left open the idea of meeting with the Ukrainian leader when world leaders gather for Pope Francis's funeral on Saturday.

On the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he could end the Ukraine-Russia war in one day, but as he approaches his 100th day in office, a truce remains elusive.

""The president is frustrated,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. ""His patience is running very thin.""

Vance warned on Wednesday that the US would ""walk away"" from its deal-making role if Russia and Ukraine do not come to an agreement - echoing comments last week by Trump and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

US officials also pulled out of a London meeting to focus on talks in Moscow, as thepace of diplomacy to end the war quickens.

The London talks between officials from the UK, France, Germany, Ukraine and the US aimed at securing a ceasefire were downgraded this week after Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff pulled out.

Instead, Trump's Ukraine envoy Gen Keith Kellogg attended the talks in London, and Witkoff will head to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin for the fourth time.

British diplomats said they were not entirely clear why Rubio and Witkoff had pulled out of the London talks.

The US state department blamed logistical reasons, but it was clear the decision was last-minute and left the Foreign Office wrongfooted.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's ministry of strategic industries, said Ukrainian negotiators would attend the London meeting on a ""very clear, narrow mandate"" to achieve a ceasefire that will ""pave the way for further talks"".

Russia intensified attacks on Ukraine since Wednesday followed a brief lull over Easter when it halted air strikes.

Putin called a temporary ceasefire for the Easter weekend but UK Defence Secretary John Healey told the House of Commons on Tuesday that British military intelligence had found no evidence of a let-up in attacks.

""While Putin has said he declared an Easter truce, he broke it,"" he said. ""While Putin says he wants peace, he has rejected a full ceasefire; and while Putin says he wants to put an end to the fighting, he continues to play for time in the negotiations.""

It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people have been killed or injured on all sides since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and nearly seven million Ukrainians are currentlylisted as refugeesworldwide.

The conflict goes back more than a decade, to 2014, when Ukraine's pro-Russian president was overthrown. Russia then annexed Crimea and backed militants in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78jx68d922o
Elon Musk to step back from Doge as Tesla profits plunge,The tech boss says he intends to spend only one to two days a week on Trump administration matters.,Technology,"Elon Musk, International Business, Tesla, Donald Trump",Lily Jamali,2025-04-22T21:28:40.597Z,2025-04-23T09:16:40.196Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/54dd/live/0534ad00-200c-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/54dd/live/0534ad00-200c-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0x50yr46lo,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to ""significantly"" cut back his role in the US government after the electric car firm reported a huge drop in profit and sales for the start of this year.

Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.

But Musk said his ""time allocation to Doge"" would ""drop significantly"" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla.

His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world.

Temporary government employees, such as Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, is set to expire late next month.

But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely.

Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk ""as long as I could keep him"".

The tech boss said he would now ""be allocating far more of my time to Tesla"", but suggested he would not leave the Trump administration completely, calling the work ""critical"" and pledging to stay on ""as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful"".

On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%.

The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying ""changing political sentiment"" could meaningfully hurt demand.

Musk blamed the boycott of Tesla cars on people who would ""try to attack me and the Doge team"".

Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results.

Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. ""Rapidly evolving trade policy"" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company.

""This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,"" Tesla's quarterly update said.

Musk hasclashedon trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.

On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were ""still tough on a company where margins are low"".

""I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,"" he said.

Earlier this month, he called Navarro a ""moron"" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was ""not a car manufacturer"" but a ""car assembler, in many cases"".

Georg Ell, who knew Musk and was director for Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme that if the multi-billionaire ""focuses on the companies where he is extraordinary, I think people will focus once again on the quality of the product and experiences"".

""I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he's a pretty single-minded individual,"" added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase.

Tesla said artificial intelligence would contribute to future growth, though investors have been unconvinced by such arguments in the past.

Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations ""rock-bottom"" after the companysaidearlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years.

The firm faces fierce competition, Mr Coatsworth said, warning that potential disruption to global supply chains as a result of Trump's trade war also created risks.

""Tesla's problems are mounting,"" he said.

The suit, which is led by New York's governor and attorney general, argues that the president lacked the authority to impose the levies. It notes such tariffs must be approved by the US Congress.

Twelve states joined the lawsuit, which was filed with the United States Court of International Trade.

The White House accused New York Attorney General Letitia James of ""prioritizing a witch hunt against President Trump over protecting the safety and wellbeing of their constituents"".

White House spokesman Kush Desai added that the ""administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing—both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit.""

The lawsuit states that tariffs must be approved by Congress and questioned Trump invoking a 1970s law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact the levies.

""By claiming the authority to impose immense and ever-changing tariffs on whatever goods entering the United States he chooses, for whatever reason he finds convenient to declare an emergency, the President has upended the constitutional order and brought chaos to the American economy,"" the lawsuit states.

Trump invoked the IEEPA as the basis for several of his tariffs against China, Mexico, Canada, and other countries.

A president can use the law ""to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States,"" if he has first declared a national emergency.

The lawsuit argues that the law does not actually grant Trump the power he claims to derive from it. The act has never been used to issue tariffs by any president,congressional research shows.

Last week, the state of Californiafiled its own lawsuitagainst the Trump administration over tariffs. That lawsuit also argues that Trump lacks the power under the IEEPA to impose these tariffs. Several other lawsuits have similarly challenged Trump's authority using that law for the levies.

Trump has implemented tariffs on global trading partners in a stated effort to correct what he believes is a trade deficit between the US and other nations.

On 2 April, in an event billed as ""Liberation Day,"" Trump shook the global economy by announcing ""reciprocal"" tariffs on nations across the world. A few days later amid a market backlash, he announced a 90-day pause on the tariffs andlowered the rate to 10% for most countries.

That pause didn't extend to China, which Trump said had a ""lack of respect"" and was retaliating. Instead, the US issued a 145% on goods imported from China, which has led to a trade standoff and rattled global markets.

On Wednesday, Trump said he hoped to come to a deal with China soon and noted the 145% tariff was ""very high"".

The White House has also imposed 25% tariffs on certain goods from it's neighbours, Mexico and Canada.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce924pnvpyvo
Harvey Weinstein rape retrial: Opening statements begin in New York,"Weinstein, who has pleaded not guilty to sex crimes, returns to court after a conviction was overturned. ",US & Canada,"Hollywood sexual harassment scandal, New York City, Harvey Weinstein trial, Harvey Weinstein, #MeToo campaign, Hollywood",Madeline Halpert,2025-04-23T11:34:51.587Z,2025-04-23T20:51:02.317Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f4cd/live/fd7ae120-1a06-11f0-8c0c-cf94af8e2715.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f4cd/live/fd7ae120-1a06-11f0-8c0c-cf94af8e2715.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn4y4pzq7o,"Attorneys delivered opening statements on Wednesday in the New York retrial of Harvey Weinstein, with prosecutors accusing the disgraced film producer of using his immense power in Hollywood to sexually harass and abuse three women.

""The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,"" Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors on Wednesday.

In his third trial in five years, Weinstein is accused of sexually abusing a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress and a model.

The former film mogul has pleaded not guilty, and in court his lawyer sought to cast doubt on the women's claims and credibility.

Attorney Arthur Aidala told the jury the prosecution case would ""fall flat on its face"" after they heard all the evidence.

""They're going to ask you to make sense of things that just don't make sense,"" he said.

A court of appeals overturned Weinstein's previous conviction for sex crimes in New York last April, before he was indicted on new sexual assault charges in the state in September.

Last week, 12 jurors - seven women and five men - were chosen to weigh Weinstein's fate.

On Wednesday, Ms Lucey spent an hour delivering an opening statement, telling jurors that three women had fallen victim to the abuse of a ""Hollywood gatekeeper"" who held ""unfettered power for over 30 years in that industry"".

The retrial in New York is centred on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, actress Jessica Mann and former TV production assistant Miriam Haley. This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16.

On Wednesday, Ms Lucey recounted the three women's stories of assault and harassment, sparing few details. The alleged encounters often involved Weinstein bringing women to his room under the guise of a business meeting, before he allegedly forced himself onto them.

Victims ""kept their shame and their pain to themselves"" for years because of Weistein's role as a man who ""defined the field"" of acting and film, Ms Lucey said.

During his hour of opening statements that followed, Weinstein's attorney took a combative approach, accusing the women of having ""mutually beneficial"" sexual relationships with Weinstein and being motivated by money.

""These women are addicted to that fame,"" Mr Aidala said. ""They want to be heroes.""

Mr Aidala argued that Weinstein could not have assaulted the women because they kept in contact with him and sent him friendly messages after the encounters.

Last April, a court of appeals said Weinstein, now 73, did not receive a fair trial in New York in 2020 because the judge overseeing his case allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him for conduct he was never charged over.

Weinstein had been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison after being convicted.

He was also found guilty of rape in a separate trial in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in that case.

Weinstein has several medical conditions, including cancer and diabetes. In September, he was taken to hospital for heart surgery and has been held in a secure hospital unit.

A judge has approved a request from Weinstein's lawyers to let him stay at the Bellevue hospital in Manhattan when he is not in court.

His lawyers had complained that he was receiving poor medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at the infamous Rikers Island prison facility - which officials have long said they plan to close - though the move has been delayed.

In total, Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by more than 100 women.

He is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison, as he has yet to begin serving his 16-year California sentence.

The decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.

Speaking to jurors on Wednesday, Ms Lucey said the movement had allowed the three women to come forward in the criminal case against Weinstein after they ""suddenly realized they were not alone"".

Before the allegations against him emerged, Weinstein and his brother Bob were among Hollywood's ultimate power players.

Weinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.

His films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 wins.

The former film mogul has also faced a number of civil lawsuits, including from a group of women who accused him of sexual harassment and rape and reached a $19m (£14.2) settlement with him in 2020.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgn4y4pzq7o
New Trump order targets university accreditation process,The executive order aims to overhaul the process colleges must go through to receive federal financial aid. ,Family & Education,"Universities, Donald Trump",Max Matza,2025-04-24T00:23:24.817Z,2025-04-24T00:24:17.580Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/46d5/live/2f3ba7a0-2095-11f0-af77-3b4a6e757c0d.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/46d5/live/2f3ba7a0-2095-11f0-af77-3b4a6e757c0d.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93gjxq0j71o,"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to overhaul university accreditation, a process colleges must go through to receive federal financial aid.

The accreditation order, a tool Trump referred to as his ""secret weapon"" during his campaign, comes as part of the president's larger effort to reshape US universities, which he argues have been corrupted by left-wing ideologies.

The order accuses university accreditors, which are independent of the US government, of having ""abused their enormous authority"".

Since taking office, Trump has moved to strip funding from universities over alleged antisemitism, and also pressured them to change certain academic programmes.

The executive order was one of seven orders focused on education which the president signed at the White House on Wednesday.

The order on accreditation accuses accreditors of having focused more on leftist ideology, including diversity, equity and inclusion programmes, rather than academic results.

""American students and taxpayers deserve better, and my Administration will reform our dysfunctional accreditation system so that colleges and universities focus on delivering high-quality academic programs at a reasonable price,"" the order states.

US accreditors play a key role in determining which universities are allowed to access billions of dollars in federal funding each year.

Trump and his allies have accused the accreditor groups of being a cartel which stifles academic diversity. The accreditors have denied that they are pushing any political agenda on campuses.

Trump's order makes it easier for universities to choose their accreditors, and for new higher learning institutions to become accredited. It also directs the government to ""take appropriate action to terminate unlawful discrimination"" found in the accreditation process.

The move comes as Trump continues his crackdown on institutions of higher learning.

He has stripped funding from some of the country's top universities, including Columbia and Harvard, demanded changes to their academic programmes, accused university leadership of tolerating antisemitism on campus, and moved to deport international students who have vocally opposed Israel's actions in Gaza.

He has also moved to dismantle the US Department of Education.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93gjxq0j71o

The lawsuit was brought by a woman who alleges Mr Sharpe used his fame to ""manipulate, control, subjugate and violate women"".

The accuser, who was 19 at the time she met Mr Sharpe in 2023, says in a legal filing that the pair had a nearly two-year relationship, during which time Mr Sharpe was ""aggressive"" and allegedly raped her.

Mr Sharpe has denied the allegations and said he is the target of a ""shakedown"".

The suit seeks more than $50 million (£37.6 million) in compensatory and punitive damages.

The accuser is the only person suing, and she does not provide details on her accusation that Mr Sharpe hurt more than herself.

According to the suit, the woman met Mr Sharpe, currently aged 56, in a Los Angeles gym and had a ""rocky consensual relationship"".

""After many months of manipulating and controlling Plaintiff — a woman more than thirty years younger than he — and repeatedly threatening to brutally choke and violently slap her, Sharpe refused to accept the answer no and raped Plaintiff, despite her sobbing and repeated screams of 'no,'"" the complaint alleges.

The woman alleges that Mr Sharpe raped her as recently as January.

In addition, she alleges in the suit  that Mr Sharpe insisted on recording some of the sexual encounters, sometimes without her consent or knowledge, shared the videos with his "" friends and associates"".

Mr Sharpe has 4 million subscribers to his Club Shay Shay podcast, and is reportedly in negotiations on a $100m deal for his network of shows.

""This is a shakedown,"" he said in a video posted to Instagram late Tuesday, addressing the lawsuit. ""I'm going to be open, transparent and defend myself, because this isn't right.""

Mr Sharpe then accused the woman's lawyer, Tony Buzbee, of filing a fraudulent lawsuit and threatened to sue for defamation.

Mr Buzbee represented a plaintiff who accused rapper Jay-z of misconduct and ultimately rescinded her allegation. He also worked with several female massage therapists who accused NFL star Deshaun Watson of sexual assault.

""I believe he's going to release a 30-second clip of a sex tape that tries to make me look guilty and play into every stereotype you could possibly imagine,"" Sharpe said. ""That video should actually be 10 minutes or so. Hey, Tony, instead of releasing your edit, put the whole video out. I don't have it, or I would myself.""

Last year, Mr Sharpe livestreamed audio of an intimate encounter with his millions of followers on Instagram, and later apologised, saying he had mistakenly turned on the app's ""Live"" feature.

Mr Sharpe played in the NFL for 14 years and won three Super Bowls. He went on to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and has had a long sports broadcasting career.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99pj3xj38do
Trump hints at softening China tariffs and says no plan to sack Fed boss Jerome Powell,"His comments come amid a trade war with Beijing, and after his attacks on the US central bank's boss.",Business,"International Business, US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, Donald Trump",João da Silva,2025-04-23T01:25:44.870Z,2025-04-23T09:10:40.315Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2cde/live/64d8f980-2027-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2cde/live/64d8f980-2027-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86jyw5jp6go,"US President Donald Trump has appeared to soften his recent comments on China and the head of the US Federal Reserve after recent clashes as he pursues his economic agenda.

Trump said he has ""no intention of firing"" Jerome Powell after repeatedly criticising the head of the central bank, but added that he would like Powell to be ""a little more active"" on cutting interest rates.

Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump also said he was optimistic about improving trade relations with China.

He said the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".

The president's tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. This is a pillar of his economic agenda - as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.

Trump has ratcheted the rate on Chinese goods up to 145% - sparking reciprocal measures from Beijing and warnings from economists about the global impact of a trade war.

In his comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he would be ""very nice"" in negotiations with Beijing - in the hope of securing a trade deal.

Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly said he expected a de-escalation of the trade war, which he said was unsustainable. Responding to comments from China, he said the current situation was ""not a joke"".

The trade war has led to turbulence in financial markets around the world - to which Trump's comments on Powell have also contributed.

The Fed has not cut rates so far this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year, a stance Trump has heavily criticised.

Last week, the president intensified his attacks on the Fed chief, calling him ""a major loser"". The comments sparked a selloff of stocks, bonds and the US dollar - though markets have since been recovering from those losses.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Friday that Trump was looking into whether it would be possible to sack Powell - who he first nominated to lead the central bank in 2017. Powell was then renewed in 2021 by Joe Biden.

It is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire the Fed chair. No other US president has tried to do so.

Most major Asian stock markets were higher on Wednesday as investors appeared to welcome the latest remarks.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose about 1.9%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed by around 2.2%, while mainland China's Shanghai Composite was down less than 0.1%.

That came after US shares made gains on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending Tuesday's session up 2.5% and the Nasdaq rose 2.7%.

US futures were also trading higher overnight. Futures markets give an indication of how financial markets will perform when they open for trading.

Investors feared that pressure on Powell to lower interest rates could cause prices to rise at a time when trade tariffs are already seen boosting inflation.

Trade tensions between the world's biggest economies, as well as US tariffs on other countries around the world, have triggered uncertainty about the global economy. Those concerns triggered turmoil in financial markets in recent weeks.

On Tuesday,the forecast for US economic growth for this yearwas given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by tariffs.

The sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a ""significant slowdown"" in global growth, the Fund predicted.

Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.

His administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.

China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to ""fight to the end"".

The Chinese government has not yet officially responded to the latest statements from the Trump administration.

However, an article in the state-controlled Global Times on Wednesday quoted commentators who said the remarks showed that the US is beginning to realise the tariffs do more harm than good to America's economy.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86jyw5jp6go
Rachel Reeves signals UK could lower US car tariffs in push for trade deal,"UK negotiators are working ""flat out"" to get a trade deal with the US, Chancellor Rachel Reeves says.",Business,"Rachel Reeves, Trump tariffs, Global trade, UK economy",Faisal Islam & Tom Espiner & Esyllt Carr,2025-04-23T17:01:09.075Z,2025-04-23T17:53:44.126Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9565/live/84c86010-2067-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9565/live/84c86010-2067-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kx1n3xgr2o,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves has signalled the UK could lower tariffs on US car imports as she tries to broker a trade deal with the Trump administration.

Reeves said she wants ""to see tariff and non-tariff barriers reduced between the UK and the US"".

The UK is seeking to lower trade taxes imposed by President Donald Trump of 25% for cars, steel and aluminium and 10% on other British exports.

One of the sticking points for a trade deal in the past has been food standards, but Reeves said the UK would not be reducing these.

Earlier today a document circulated among US business groups and unions seeking views on a potential deal with the UK, focused on lowering UK tariffs on US cars to 2.5% from their current 10%.

The chancellor suggested she was open to this to secure a wider trade deal.

President Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US – including from the UK.

The UK is also facing a broader tariff rate of 10%, and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies – most of which are currently on pause until July.

UK negotiators are working ""flat out"" to get an agreement that is in the country's national interest, Reeves told the BBC at an event in Washington.

""We are willing to reduce trade barriers in the UK, those trade barriers that do exist. And we want to build on the relationship that we have,"" she added later speaking at a Semafor event.

Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a ""good chance"" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.

Speaking to the BBC at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) event on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK was ""not going to rush into a deal"".

But she said the government was ""confident that working with our partners in the US we can get a better trading relationship and build on the substantial trade that already exists between our two great countries"".

""We want to get the right deal for Britain, to better support our industry, our jobs and consumers,"" she added.

Reeves said that the UK had been ""really clear"" in discussions with US negotiators ""that we're not going to be reducing agricultural standards in the UK"".

""The US administration respect and understand that we have high standards to support British farming, and to support British consumers, and we're not going to be relaxing those standards,"" she said.

Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s.

The US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones.

Farmers in the UK warned ministers last week not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in rearing livestock cannot be accepted.

Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would ""expect"" Reeves to stick to agricultural standards ""but let's see the detail as and when there is a deal"".

He said it is ""hugely important"" to ""get these 25% tariffs on cars and steel down"" but he said the government should be moving faster on negotiations.

""It's taken them a long time, in fact, to even have got in the room with the US administration to start discussing these issues, let alone getting a deal now,"" he said.

Trump has brought in a large number of tariffs on imports to the US, arguing they will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs.

These include, as part of an ongoing trade war, levies of up to 145% on Chinese goods. China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.

The move has rattled the world economy, sparking turmoil on global financial markets.

Prices are expected to rise for consumers in the US as a result of the tariffs, due to the companies importing goods passing on higher costs.

The IMF has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty caused by tariffs, and says it expects US growth to be hit the hardest.

On Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK must take the risk of trade wars hitting global economic growth ""very seriously"".

However, Reeves said: ""I do understand the concerns the US has about countries around the world that run large and persistent trade surpluses with the US.""

She said the UK ""is not one of those countries"" so ""there is a deal there to be done between the UK and the US"".

She added that she understood ""the need to rebalance the global economy"".

This, in part, is why the UK announced on Wednesday a review of low-value imports coming into the UK which are ""undercutting the British High Street and British retailers"" she said.

This mirrors a US action, with the White House set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May.

It is set to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.

The removal of the so-called ""de minimis"" rule will hit companies including fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant.

Shein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices ""due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs"".

It has issued a €500m (£428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined €200m (£171m) over how much choice users had to consent to data collection.

""We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,"" Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.

The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of ""attempting to handicap successful American businesses"" and Apple saying it was being ""unfairly targeted"" and forced to ""give away our technology for free.""

The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump.

The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of ""taking advantage"" of America.

EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were ""completely separate"", telling the BBC: ""This is about enforcement, it's not about trade negotiations.""

The White House has been contacted for comment.

The European Commission - the EU's executive - started both investigationslast yearunder a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

The case against Apple wasover its App Store.

The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this.

Meanwhile, Meta's fine was over the choices it offered on data collection.

Meta introduced a ""consent or pay"" model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, orpaying a monthly subscription.

The Commission says this model did not allow users to freely consent to how their data was used.

In November, Meta introduced another option, which the Commission says ""allegedly uses less personal data to display advertisements.""

The Commission is currently assessing the new option.

In both cases, the Commission says the size of the fine takes into account ""the gravity and duration of the non-compliance"".

Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines.

""Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,"" said Commissioner Teresa Ribera.

""As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules.""

Apple said the Commission had made ""a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.""

It also accused the Commission of ""[moving] the goal posts"" during their meetings.

Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses.

""This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,"" it said in a statement.

The fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction ofGoogle's €2.4bn finefrom last September.

But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation.

In February, Donald Trump's White House issueda memorandumcomplaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms.

""Today's decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,"" Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC.

Prof Witt said the disagreement was ""not so much about substantive antitrust principles,"" given the US government is itself takinga number of big tech companies to courtover alleged monopoly power.

They are more ""about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,"" she added.

One company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite.

They had along-running disputeover the distribution of their apps on Apple devices.

Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was ""great news for app developers worldwide"" ina thread on X.

He urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple's App Store, which charges fees for using its platform.

A US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision.

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission ""has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U.S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures.""

""The Commission's actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,"" it said.

The UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after adigital competition lawwas brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares.

""Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems andGoogle's general searchand search advertising services are currently being investigated for potentially having this status, and it is likely that other US tech giants and platforms will face similar investigations in the near future,"" said Andrew Maxwell, partner at law firm Freeths.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm248vzg9jwo

Asked about an upcoming meeting between the countries, Bessent said it would be an ""incredible opportunity"" to strike an agreement, if China was ""serious"" on making its economy less dependent on manufacturing exports.

""China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change because we need rebalancing too,"" he said.

The comments come as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated in recent weeks.

US President Donald Trump has brought in a number of tariffs on imports to the US which he has said are aimed at increasing US manufacturing and protecting jobs.

These include import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods, but China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.

Speaking at the Institute of International Finance conference on Wednesday, Bessent, said it was a ""matter of impetus and will"".

""There is an opportunity for a big deal here, that the US is looking to rebalance to more manufacturing, the identity of that would be less consumption.

""If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth, and a rebalancing towards a domestic economy… if they want to rebalance, let's do it together.""

The comments come after Bessent reportedly said on Tuesday that heexpected a de-escalation of the trade warand that the current situation was ""not a joke"".

Trump has also said he is optimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".

Tensions between China and the US have shaken investors, with violent swings in share prices and sharp falls in the dollar.

Stocks surged on Wednesday on hopes that trade tensions between the US and China could soon ease.

Aside from the trade war, Bessent called on the IMF and the World Bank to refocus on the core missions of economic stability and development, arguing that they had strayed too far into vanity projects such as ""climate change, gender and social issue"".

""These issues are not the IMF's mission,"" he said.

Tensions between the countries have rattled financial markets, with both sides introducing strong tariffs on each other.

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said that he was ""very frankly encouraged"" by Bessent's comments on the IMF and World Bank.

Although Mr Bessent said the IMF and the World Bank are ""falling short"" he did not call for the US to withdraw from the institutions as some conservatives have lobbied for.

Advance polling stations were open across the country for four days, from Friday to Monday, over the Easter long weekend. Poll workers reported long lines, with two million people casting their ballots last Friday alone.

With less than one week to go before election day on 28 April, federal leaders are now in the final stretch of campaigning.

Voters will consider which party should govern the country amid an ongoing trade war with the US and President Donald Trump's repeated comments about making Canada the 51st US state.

Elections Canada, the organisation which runs federal elections, said 7.3 million Canadians - about a quarter of eligible voters - had cast their ballots, marking a 25% increase from early votes in the previous 2021 election.

Mail-in voting is up as well, with over 754,000 returning their special ballots to the  federal agency. That is more than the 660,000 that did so in 2021.

Latest polling suggests Liberals have  a 5-point lead over the main opposition Conservative party, as campaigning enters its last stretch.

Liberal leader Mark Carney held events in Prince Edward Island and Quebec, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had a rally in Vaughan, a suburb of Toronto, on Tuesday evening.

Carney, the former central banker of Canada and the UK, has touted his party as the best option to deal with Trump and his tariffs.

""Pierre Poilievre has no plan to stand up to President Trump,"" Carney told supporters on Tuesday.

The US president has implemented blanket 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, with an exemption on products covered by the USMCA - a North American free trade deal.

Canada is also hit with global US tariffs on steel and aluminium, and cars.

The northern country does a majority of its trade with the US, and the tariffs have already resulted in thousands of temporary layoffs in Canada's auto sector.

A win for the Liberals would mark a dramatic reversal of fortune for the party, which had been polling at just 20% when former Liberal leader and prime minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation in late January.

Their main rivals, the Conservatives, have focused their campaigning on Canadians' desire for change following nine years of leadership under Trudeau.

At rallies and events across the country, Poilievre has honed in on issues like housing, crime and the high cost of living, while criticising the Liberals for government overspending.

""It's time for the government to start pinching pennies,"" Poilievre said on Tuesday as he unveiled his party's platform, before adding: ""We can choose change. We can choose hope. We can choose our future.""

The group visited two Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facilities where former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, a graduate student at Tufts University in Massachusetts, are being held.

The pair were detained separately in March by immigration officers.

Their arrests form part of the White House's crackdown on what it has classified as antisemitism on US college campuses.

Mr Khalil participated in pro-Palestinian protests on the Columbia campus.

Ms Öztürk co-wrote an opinion piece in 2024 for her student newspaper, calling on her university to ""acknowledge the Palestinian genocide"".

She also criticised Tufts for its leadership after its response to the student resolutions that it disclose its investments and divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.

The Democratic group who visited the pair included representatives Troy Carter of Louisiana, Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, Jim McGovern and Ayana Pressley of Massachusetts, and Senator Edward J Markey, also of Massachusetts.

The visit was ""to let them know we stand firm with them, in support of free speech"" Carter told reporters after the meeting. He said the facilities seemed ""clean"", but that multiple detainees complained about cold room temperatures.

Markey noted that neither student had been charged with any crime. He accused the White House of sending them to a Republican-led state in an effort to ""circumscribe the constitutional rights of Rümeysa Öztürk and Mahmoud Khalil"".

Ms Öztürk has suffered multiple asthma attacks while in custody, he said, adding that she and other detainees inside the facility were ""not getting the medical attention which they need and deserve"".

Mahmoud Khalil, who is a green card-holder, has been at the Louisiana detention centre since 8 March, when immigration officers told him he was being deported for taking part in protests against the war in Gaza.

The 30-year-old, who lives in New York, was a student negotiator at Columbia University during the pro-Palestinian protests there last year.

The Trump administration cited a 1952 law empowering the government to deport someone if their presence in the country posed unfavourable consequences for American foreign policy.

A judge in Louisiana said the Trump administration wasallowed to move forward with its effort to deport Mr Khalilbecause the argument of ""adverse foreign policy consequences"" for the US was ""facially reasonable"".

In a recent open letter, Mr Khalil argued that the American public should now see their country as ""a democracy of convenience, and rights are granted to those who align with power.""

His lawyers have told the BBC that they will continue to seek bail, as well as a preliminary injunction, to free him from custody.

His wife, Noor Abdalla, gave birth to their first child on Monday. She said Mr Khalil's application for a temporary release from the detention centre to attend the birth was declined.

""This was a purposeful decision by Ice to make me, Mahmoud, and our son suffer,"" Ms Abdalla said.

Ms Öztürk is a Turkish national who was in the US on a student visa that has now been revoked. She wasdetained on 25 March outside Boston, as she was walking to an Iftar meal to celebrate Ramadan.Masked, plain-clothes officers handcuffed and lead her to an unmarked car.

Last week the US District Court for the District of Vermont ruled that her challenge to her detention by Ice should continue in Vermont and the government should transfer her back to a facility in Vermont no later than 1 May. The court also set a bail hearing for 9 May.

The two students are among the most high-profile detainees to be arrested since Trump returned to office. The congressional delegation that visited the Louisiana facility also spoke of other detainees, including Wendy Brito, a New Orleans mother who has lived in the US for over 15 years, and another woman who they said was six months pregnant.

Legal teams for both students allege that choosing a Louisiana jail was a deliberate attempt to keep them away from their homes.

A statement Tuesday from the Democrats accuses the Trump administration of ""ripping individuals from their communities and shipping them to jurisdictions more favourable to the Trump administration's deportation agenda"".

They argue that the government moved Ms Öztürk to Louisiana in ""an attempt to hand-pick the courts that will decide her case"", instead of lack of bed space in her home state as it claimed.

The statement demanded that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and the acting director of Ice, Todd Lyons, answer questions about the decision to move Ms Öztürk.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx411nnwy8o
Trump administration proposes State Department cuts in overhaul,The cuts involve some 130 of the more than 700 agency offices within the State Department. ,US & Canada,"Donald Trump, United States",Tom Bateman,2025-04-22T19:23:07.711Z,2025-04-22T19:23:07.711Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/08c7/live/4be5f900-1f9b-11f0-afee-89ab52a5298c.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/08c7/live/4be5f900-1f9b-11f0-afee-89ab52a5298c.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg2y21yq5o,"The Trump administration is proposing a major overhaul of the US State Department that would involve axing a war crimes office and shifting the focus of staff looking at migration and refugees.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the restructure was designed to get rid of offices that are ""misaligned with America's core national interests"".

The planned cuts at the department include the Office of Global Criminal Justice, which helps set policy on the US response to war crimes and genocide.

A State Department spokesperson denied that Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) was behind the proposal.

The proposal would eliminate around 130 of 732 domestic offices and scrap 700 jobs as part of what Rubio presented as a major restructure which he said would cut out ""radical ideologues"" and ""bureaucratic infighters"".

Rubio said the State Department cost and size had ""ballooned"" in the past 15 years.

""The problem is not lack of money, or even dedicated talent, but rather a system where everything takes too much time, costs too much money, involves too many individuals, and all too often ends up failing the American people,"" Rubio said on Tuesday.

Another office whose functions look set to be radically changed is one which deals with refugees and migration.

The proposed overhaul does not go as far as some US media reported in the run up to the announcement. It does not impact US embassies and missions overseas, and some functions of offices being cut look set to be moved into other offices that will be retained.

But the planned changes are significant and echo the kind of language the White House and Musk, who has been tasked with slashing the size and spending of the government, have been using since Trump took office.

They have said the US government is beholden to radically liberal civil servants who stifle their conservative agenda, a position vehemently rejected by critics who have condemned the cuts.

Jeanne Shaheen, the leading Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, said she would scrutinise the proposed reforms, adding that the Trump administration had engaged in a ""slash and burn"" campaign of the federal government.

""The lack of transparency to date only underscores that they know this process has been deeply flawed,"" she said.

When asked whether Doge was involved in the proposal, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said: ""Doge was not in charge of this, but this is the result of what we've learned.""

Musk has already overseen the scrapping of the foreign assistance agency USAID, which has had most of its functions axed.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yg2y21yq5o

Over 1,300 VOA employees, including about 1,000 journalists, were placed on  leave following President Donald Trump's order. The White House has accused the broadcaster of being""anti-Trump"" and ""radical"".

VOA, still primarily a radio service, was set up during World War II to counter Nazi propaganda, and has become a major global media broadcaster.

The ruling noted that because of the cuts, ""VOA is not reporting the news for the first time in its 80-year existence"".

Judge Royce Lamberth said the administration acted ""without regard to the harm inflicted on employees, contractors, journalists, and media consumers around the world"".

He ordered the administration to take steps to restore employees and contractors to the jobs they had prior to the executive order, and to do the same for Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks.

The judge found the administration also likely violated the International Broadcasting Act and Congress' power to appropriate funding.

""My colleagues and I are grateful for this ruling. But we know that this is just a small step forward, as the government is likely to appeal,"" said Patsy Widakuswara, the VOA White House bureau chief and a lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.

""We are committed to continuing to fight against what we believe is the administration's unlawful silencing of VOA until we can return to our congressional mandate: to tell America's stories with factual, balanced, and comprehensive,  reporting,"" she said.

Trump has long criticised VOA as part of his broader attacks against the media, frequently accusing mainstream outlets of bias.

After taking office in January, he appointed a political ally, Kari Lake, to run VOA. Lake has previously supported Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.

In March, Trump ordered the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which oversees VOA and funds outlets like Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia, to be ""eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law"".

A separate judge in New York temporarily blocked the executive order after journalists, advocacy groups and unions sued, arguing the move was unlawful.

Judge Lamberth, who is based in Washington, DC, ruled the Trump administration lacked the authority to shutter VOA, which is funded by Congress and has a legislative mandate to deliver credible news globally.

""It is hard to fathom a more straightforward display of arbitrary and capricious actions than the Defendants' actions here,"" he wrote.

""Even though several courts have ruled that the President can remove personnel and terminate grants, a radical district judge is once again attempting to interfere with the Trump Administration's efforts to make the government more efficient,"" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement.

The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.

Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.

It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.

In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.

That sense of unity is now long gone.

Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.

As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.

However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.

The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.

It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as ""Carbon Tax Carney"".

Some observers believe that cancelling the tax was a smart political move, others feel it was a mistake.

""By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,"" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.

""I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.""

Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into ""a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy"".

He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.

There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.

Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.

The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.

""We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,"" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.

""And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.""

Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.

He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers ""woke"" cultural issues.

Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.

While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace ""dirty coal"" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.

According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.

He told the BBC it's more ""at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable"".

Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.

That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.

Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.

""Our relationship with the US has completely changed,"" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.

""The pipelines are a national security problem for us.""

That concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets.

A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles.

In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track ""energy corridors"",  though Carneyhas flip-flopped on his support for pipelines,knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.

He is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn;  £4.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023.

And while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments.

Yves-François Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Québécois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a ""denial situation about climate change"".

""I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales"" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates.

Canada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005.

As of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%.

Whoever wins the election will have a real challenge to square that circle.

The leaders of major parties participated in debates on Wednesday (in French) and Thursday (in English), pitching their visions for the future of the country during an uncertain time.

On stage were Liberal leader Mark Carney, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, the NDP's Jagmeet Singh and the Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet.

The BBC has spoken to seven voters who watchedThursday's debate, as they work out who to cast their ballot for on 28 April. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.

Kim, 36, said she liked that the leaders focused on substance during the debate, and found Mark Carney to be a breath of fresh air.

Today's debate was surprising in terms of the dynamic between the candidates. I think it was a bit more centred around content than blaming one another.

I find it refreshing that Carney is not a career politician, and it showed in the debate. The way he spoke was business-like - in both the French and English debates - and he was able to express his points very clearly compared to practiced politicians.

Pierre Poilievre felt like a broken record, constantly looking at the camera to send his message. It was like watching an advertisement.

My values align with the NDP, but I don't think Singh can be a leader for the Canadians. So my vote is still for Carney, as I think he has the best plan.

John, who is 64 and works in construction, was disappointed by the overall quality of the debate but said the Conservative leader was the clear winner.

The debate was all very respectful. I didn't get a sense that anyone was having a go at each other, unlike in the good old days of hot-headed debate - those days seem to be over.

Pierre Poilievre was the winner at the end of the day. I don't think there was a big difference between him and Carney, but Poilievre was better for sure.

Poilievre made some good points, pointing to the nine-and-a-half years of the Liberals in power and the catastrophic mess they've made. Carney tried to pitch himself as some kind of Lancelot figure, but didn't come across as different to what was there before.

At the end of it, I was disappointed. I didn't feel anyone left the table with a phenomenal finish.

Thomas, 29, has lived in the UK and is voting in his first Canadian election.

I think it was a pretty good debate, and nothing too crazy was said. The Liberal and Conservative leaders stayed on track, sticking to their initial messages.

The loser of the debate was Jagmeet Singh. He came across a bit desperate and frantic in the way he was trying to attack on multiple fronts.

The key thing that stood out for me was that all the leaders were emphasising a strong Canada in the face of foreign influence.

My big concerns were the environment, the cost of living and a strong Canada - they addressed those issues well, although I don't think anything new was brought up.

On the whole, the debate was civil, useful, and very Canadian.

54-year-old Thierry said the debate highlighted the contrast in rhetoric between the Liberal and Conservative parties in Canada.

Pierre Poilievre showed a more prime ministerial attitude today, rather than being the attack dog he has been over the past few months.

But his pre-formatted spiel was very annoying - it was as if he was trying to beat it into voters that 10 years of Liberal government was bad for Canada.

We also saw a Mark Carney who was very confident, very respectful, quite the opposite of what the Conservative party has shown so far in mimicking the Republican party in the US in terms of rhetoric.

The standout moment was when Mark Carney told Poilievre that the carbon tax and Trudeau were ""both gone"" - to me that was akin to a smash that is unexpected in a tennis match. A highlight, and a very effective and honest response.

Lindsey, a 61-year-old retired civil servant, was impressed with the performance of Yves-Francois Blanchet.

This debate reinforced a few things, but didn't change anything.

From a western Canadian perspective, the Bloc Quebecois leader had a few good comments. I liked that he said he was willing to work within the Canadian federation as long as Quebec's sovereignty is respected. It's not something we understand in western Canada.

He's not someone I'll be able to vote for, but I was impressed by his performance.

The 57-year-old university professor said the debate reinforced his feeling that Canada is in good hands whoever is elected.

I'm personally confident that either Pierre Poilievre or Mark Carney are capable leaders, and I'm not worried about whether the wrong person wins.

I'm more worried about the next year when the world might be on fire, as Trump seems prepared to make such extreme moves. Nothing is off the table with him.

If we go into a crisis, I'm sure Poilievre and Carney will put aside their differences and work together and do the job as well as it can be done.

So to the extent that Canada can be well prepared in the face of this looming threat, I'm confident that whoever the leader is is going to be able to manage it as well as it can be managed.

41-year-old Adrienne said the debate showed off the strength of Canada's democracy, but hoped for more of a concrete discourse on climate policy.

I am proud of the quality of the debate - it was respectful, dignified dialogue between high-calibre politicians. Canada has once again demonstrated to the world that it is a strong, multi-party democracy.

Mark Carney's idea of free trade in Canada by Canada day is a winning policy, and the concept of a national bureau to address the housing crisis - which was mentioned during the French debate - is one that should be explored.

But I found it difficult to relate to the picture that the Conservative leader was painting of the current Canadian experience in the sense that there is widespread chaos and crime.

I wish there was more in the public discourse about the climate crisis and that leaders had to commit to climate action. I agree that Canada could be a clean energy superpower, but that they made no commitment was a little disappointing - which could have happened had the Green party been invited.

Canada's 'regular' homes now cost millions. Can a new government fix it?,"Housing has taken a backseat in Canada's election to Donald Trump's tariffs, but advocates argue the affordability crisis is just as disruptive.",US & Canada,"Housing, Canada election 2025, British Columbia, Canada",Nadine Yousif,2025-04-18T00:06:48.923Z,2025-04-18T00:06:48.923Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b557/live/83ad2730-1a34-11f0-b287-9bbf4848835b.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b557/live/83ad2730-1a34-11f0-b287-9bbf4848835b.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy70y75v5l7o,"Before Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened its sovereignty, the Canadian psyche was consumed with another major issue: housing affordability. With an election on the horizon, voters are wondering if any party has a plan to fix what has become a generational problem.

Willow Yamauchi says she was just a ""regular"" person when she and her husband bought their family home in Vancouver 25 years ago for a modest sum of C$275,000 - around C$435,000 ($312,000; £236,400) in today's dollars.

That same property is now worth several million.

In the city on Canada's west coast, Ms Yamauchi's story is as common as the rainy weather. The average price of a detached home in Vancouver in 2000 was around C$350,000. Now, it is more than C$2m.

""My husband and I were very privileged to be able to purchase a house when we did,"" the 52-year-old writer tells the BBC. As a member of Generation X, timing was on her side.

The same, she says, cannot be said for younger people, who - without ""the bank of mom and dad"" - are effectively priced out of the city they grew up in.

Vancouver, a cultural and economic hub with a population of less than one million, is often seen as the epicentre of Canada's housing crisis. A report byChapman University in California last yearlisted it among the top ""impossibly unaffordable"" cities in the world.

But it is not the only Canadian city where the cost of homes is out of reach for many. Canada as a whole has one of the highest house-price-to-income ratios among developed nations.

In 2021, the average household income after taxes in Canada was around C$88,000, according to national data. That same year, the average home price hit C$713,500 - more than eight times higher. The gap is even larger in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver.

For many Canadians, housing isone of the top issues in the federal election, eclipsed only recently by US President Donald Trump and his tariffs on Canada.

Before Trump, concerns on housing affordability had boosted the Conservative Party, which has consistently been seen as the best equipped to fix the crisis.

But then a trade war with the US came along and it catapulted the governing Liberal party to the top of the polls.

Even with the Trump factor, the topic featured prominently in the two election debates this week. During the French language one, moderator and journalist Patrice Roy displayed figures showing how much home prices had increased in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in the last decade.

""I'm sure this won't come as a surprise,"" Mr Roy told the federal leaders, before asking for their plans on how they would fix the crisis.

Polls show young people are especially worried about the housing crisis and what it means for their future.

Speaking to students at the University of British Columbia's (UBC) Vancouver campus, it quickly became clear that the issue was top of mind for many.

Many said they have either opted to live at home during their studies to save on costs, or are paying anywhere from C$1,100 to C$1,500 for a single room near campus, often in a home shared with five or six others.

Emily Chu, a 24-year-old who is in her final semester at UBC, says that she at one point had to delay her studies by two years in order to work, as she struggled to afford paying both tuition and rent.

She now shares an apartment with her older brother, who works full-time and pays the majority of the rent. Ms Chu considers herself one of the lucky ones.

As for home ownership in the future, she says ""that's not even possible"" for most people her age. ""Everybody kind of assumes that we can't ever own housing.""

Young professionals with well-paying jobs, like Margareta Dovgal, are also priced out. The 28-year-old director at Vancouver-based non-profit Resource Works told the BBC that she has considered moving to the neighbouring province of Alberta due to its lower cost of living, despite being a lifelong and ""committed Vancouverite"".

Still, Calgary, Alberta's largest city, sawhouse prices increase by 15% in 2024 from the previous yearas the city experienced itshighest population growth ratesince 2001.

The root causes of Canada's housing affordability crisis are complex. One of the main issues is a supply that has not kept up with a growing population, which has driven up costs for both buyers and renters.

The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the national housing agency, estimates that more than 3.8 million homes need to be built in the next six years to address the shortage.

Construction of new housing, however,has been well below that target, raising questions on whether Canada will meet this goal. Experts say barriers to ramping up building include the high cost and scarcity of land in urban areas, where most Canadians tend to live and work.

There are also regional barriers, like city zoning laws that prevent the construction of more affordable, higher density housing - including apartment buildings or multiplexes - in some neighbourhoods.

Daniel Oleksiuk, co-founder of the advocacy group Abundant Housing Vancouver, says his city is one example, where more than half of the land has historically been zoned for single-family homes.

""We've kept almost all of the land reserved,"" Mr Oleksiuk told the BBC. ""There are whole neighbourhoods where all you have is three to five million dollar homes.""

On the campaign trail, each major federal party has put forward a plan to fix the crisis, all with the goal of building as many homes as quickly as possible.

The Liberals, led by Mark Carney, said their aim is to build 500,000 new homes a year with the help of a new government agency called Build Canada Homes that would oversee and finance the construction of affordable housing in Canada - a plan similar to one implemented after the Second World War to house veterans.

Critics have questioned whether Carney's target is viable, as it would require Canada to more than double its current construction rate.

Meanwhile, the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, vowed to tie federal funding to housing starts by rewarding cities that build more homes and penalising those that block construction - a carrot-and-stick approach.

Poilievre also promised to remove federal taxes on newly constructed homes in an effort to cut costs to would-be homebuyers. Critics, however, say this policy may have minimal effect, as most homes purchased in Canada are resold, rather than brand new.

Voters who spoke to the BBC say they welcome any plan to ramp up housing construction in Canada.

While much of housing is governed by provinces and cities, Ms Dovgal notes that the federal government has an ability ""to lead persuasively"" and implement measures that make it cheaper and easier to build across the country.

But others watching the issue closely caution that the steps proposed may not be enough.

Paul Kershaw, a public policy professor at UBC and founder of think tank Generation Squeeze, argues that politicians have failed to address the elephant in the room: the wealth older homeowners have generated off the housing crisis.

""The political bargain has asked younger Canadians to suffer higher rents and mortgages in order to protect those higher home values,"" Kershaw notes.

""None of the parties are really naming that generational tension,"" he says, adding that politicians may privately feel there is a political risk in trying to stall the cost of housing, and thus, older Canadians' assets.

Prof Kershaw calls this a ""cultural problem"", and says that parties should also focus on reducing costs for younger people as a way to alleviate this generational burden.

Fixing the housing crisis, he argues, is just as integral as asserting sovereignty and prosperity in the face of threats posed by Trump's tariffs.

The ""dysfunction that has entered our housing market is disruptive to the well-being of the country"", he says.

Until a fix is found, the possibility of homeownership still looks bleak for many.

Ms Dovgal contends half-heartedly that, other than moving elsewhere, ""you have to win the lottery, or marry a multi-millionaire. These are kind of the options"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy70y75v5l7o
What Trump really wants from Canada,Donald Trump's return to the White House has created flashpoints between the North American neighbours.,BBC InDepth,Donald Trump,Anthony Zurcher,2025-04-14T23:36:35.708Z,2025-04-14T23:36:35.708Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6f57/live/7d1c8db0-1940-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6f57/live/7d1c8db0-1940-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15vl99dw0do,"Machias Seal Island is a tiny dot on maps of North America. But the fogbound rock is significant for its location in an area known as the ""Grey Zone"" – the site of a rare international dispute between Canada and the United States.

The two neighbours and long-time allies have each long laid claim to the island and surrounding water, where the US state of Maine meets Canada's New Brunswick province – and with that claim, the right to catch and sell the prized local lobsters.

John Drouin, a US lobsterman who has fished in the Grey Zone for 30 years, tells of the mad dash by Canadian and American fishermen to place lobster traps at the start of the summer catching season each year.

""People have literally lost parts of their bodies, have had concussions, [their] head smashed and everything,"" he says.

The injuries have been caused when lobstermen have been caught up in each other's lines. He says one friend lost his thumb after it became caught up in a Canadian line, what Mr Drouin calls his battle scar from the Grey Zone.

The 277 square miles of sea around Machias Seal Island has been under dispute since the late 1700s – and in 1984, an international court ruling gave both the US and Canada the right to fish in the waterway.

It has stood as a quirk – an isolated area of tension in what had been, until now, an otherwise close relationship between the two countries.

But that could all be about to change.

US President Donald Trump's return to the White House, steep tariffs on Canadian imports and rhetoric about making the country the 51st state has sparked a series of fresh flashpoints, with the possibility that he may ultimately wish to subsume Canada into the US hanging over everything. Amid the biggest shift in the relationship between the two countries in decades, the question is, what does he really want from Canada?

Cutler, Maine, is the closest US town to the Grey Zone. It has a collection of scattered houses, one supply store and, for good reason, a lobster wholesaler.

Aside from a few big-city retirees and holiday-goers, Cutler owes its existence to the bountiful crustaceans that inhabit the offshore waters. And for the lobstermen of Cutler, the international limbo of the Grey Zone is their everyday reality, as they scatter their traps along the bottom of the Gulf of Maine to catch the prized lobsters and bring them to market.

During lobster season, the Grey Zone is packed with boats and buoys marking the location of their traps. When the waters get crowded and livelihoods are at stake, things can get ugly.

""Do we like it? Not in the least,"" says Mr Drouin. He has caught lobsters in the Grey Zone for 30 years. ""I will continue to complain about it until I can't breathe anymore.""

Another Maine lobsterman, Nick Lemieux, said he and his sons have had nearly 200 traps stolen in recent years – and he blames their rivals to the north.

""This is our area, and it's all we have to work with,"" he said. ""Things like that don't sit very well with us.""

Americans accuse the Canadians of operating under a different, more accommodating set of rules that allow them to catch larger lobsters.

Canadians counter that the Americans have higher catch limits and are surreptitiously fishing in their territorial waters.

The union representing Canada's fishery officials recently complained that Americans have responded to their enforcement efforts with threats of violence – and some of its officers have refused to work in the Grey Zone.

The Machias Seal Island lightstation has lightkeepers on site all year round but the Canadian Coast Guard sends additional technical support if there is an issue with the automated aid to navigation.

The Americans point to US Marines who occupied the island during World War One as their proof of sovereignty.

The dispute appears to be going nowhere, but during Trump's first presidency, events in the Grey Zone did not appear to be intruding greatly on the overall warmth between the US and Canada.

When Trump hosted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House in 2017, he spoke about the US-Canada relationship in glowing terms, remarking on the ""special bonds"" between the two nations that ""share much more than a border"".

Yet his rhetoric has since changed sharply.

In recent months, Trump has repeatedly called Canada the ""51st state"" of the US – and the White House has expressed a willingness to open up new areas of dispute all along the US-Canada border.

In September, the president voiced designs on Canadian water in British Columbia in the west of the country, for instance, suggesting it could be piped to drought-parched California: ""You have millions of gallons of water pouring down from the north… they have essentially a very large faucet"".

Approximately 1,500 miles further east, the Great Lakes could become another site of potential conflict, as US officials told their Canadian counterparts they are considering withdrawing from treaties over their coordinated environmental regulation.

And even further east, a library has become the unlikely setting for a flashpoint: built deliberately to straddle the Vermont-Quebec border as a symbol of cooperation between Canada and the US, the Haskell Free Library and Opera House used to be open to residents from both nations.

However in March, America changed the rules so that Canadians are required to pass through immigration control before they access the building, with the US Department of Homeland Security claiming it was in response to drug trafficking.

Natural resources are another source of dispute. Canada has vast supplies of rare earth metals, gold, oil, coal and lumber – the kind of natural wealth that Trump has long prized.

While Trump has disavowed any desire for Canada's lumber, energy stockpiles or manufactured products, in February Trudeau reportedly told a closed-door meeting of Canadian business and labour leaders that he saw it differently.

""I suggest that not only does the Trump administration know how many critical minerals we have but that may even be why they keep talking about absorbing us and making us the 51st state. They're very aware of our resources, of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those,"" the CBC quoted Trudeau as saying.

Jordan Heath-Rawlings, a Canadian journalist and host of The Big Story podcast, believes Trump wants Canadian resources, and that the president's annexation comments should be taken seriously.

""He likes the idea of being the guy to bring in a huge land mass,"" says Mr Heath-Rawlings. ""He probably wants the Arctic, which is obviously going to become much more valuable in the years to come.""

For Trump, even the US-Canadian border itself is suspect. ""If you look at a map, they drew an artificial line right through it between Canada and the US,"" he said in March. ""Somebody did it a long time ago, and it makes no sense.""

Needless to say, Trump's comments have rankled Canadian leaders, who warn of the president's ultimate designs on their homeland.

In March, Trudeau accused the US president of planning ""a total collapse of the Canadian economy because that will make it easier to annex us"".

The previous month, after Trump first announced new tariffs on Canada, Trudeau had said: ""Trump has it in mind that one of the easiest ways of doing that [annexing Canada] is absorbing our country. And it is a real thing.""

If US territorial ambitions for Canada are, in fact, a ""real thing"", it presents a simple, vexing question. Why? Why would the US, which has had the closest of diplomatic, military, economic and cultural ties with its northern neighbour for more than a century, put all of that at risk?

Some see a pattern in Trump's designs on Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal – one that reflects a dramatic change in how the US sees itself in the world.

It has been most clearly articulated by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said in January that the post-World War Two dominance of the US was more the exception than the norm.

""Eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multi-polar world, multiple great powers in different parts of the planet,"" he said. ""We face that now with China and to some extent Russia, and … rogue states like Iran and North Korea.""

According to Michael Williams, professor of international affairs at the University of Ottawa, if the current Trump administration thinks that American world dominance is no longer possible or even desired, the US might pull back from far-flung conflicts and European commitments.

Instead, says Prof Williams, the US would prioritise its ""territorial core"", creating a continental fortress of sorts, insulated on both sides by the vastness of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

""If this is your plan, you seek to control key geographic choke points,"" he says. ""You maximise access to natural resources, of which Canada has plenty, and you reshore industry whenever possible.""

Such a geopolitical outlook is hardly new. In the 1820s, US President James Monroe articulated a new global order in which America and Europe confined themselves to their own hemispheres.

But it does represent a remarkable shift in US foreign policy since the end of World War Two.

Prof Williams acknowledges that it's difficult to figure out exactly what the US president is thinking – a view wholeheartedly endorsed by John Bolton, who served as Trump's national security adviser for more than a year of his first presidential term.

""Trump has no philosophy,"" he says. ""He gets ideas, but does not follow a coherent pattern. There is no underlying strategy.""

The president is currently fixated on minerals and natural resources, he said, but Mr Bolton argues the best way to go about doing that is through the private sector, not by floating the idea of annexing an ally. Canada, for its part, has offered to work with US companies on joint mining partnerships.

Prof Williams and Mr Bolton agree that whatever the motivations behind Trump's designs on Canada, the diplomatic damage that's being done will be difficult to undo – and the possibility of unanticipated consequences is high.

""Trump likes to say in a lot of contexts that other people don't have any cards,"" says Prof Williams. ""But the further you push people to the wall, the more you may find that they have cards that you didn't know they had – and they might be willing to play them. And even if you have more cards, the consequences of doing so can easily spiral out of control in some really bad ways.""

Canadians have already been boycotting US products and cancelling winter trips south, which has had an impact on tourist communities in Florida.

""We're not looking for a fight, but Canada's ready for one,"" says Mr Heath-Rawlings.

The idea that the trust between the US and Canada has been broken is one that's been embraced by the country's new prime minister, Mark Carney, as a general election looms.

""The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over,"" he said recently. ""I reject any attempts to weaken Canada, to wear us down, to break us so that America can own us.""

Back in the 19th Century, territorial conflicts and flare-ups along the US-Canada border were a more frequent occurrence. Americans made multiple unsuccessful attempts to capture Canadian territory during the 1812 War.

In 1844, some Americans called for military force if the UK wouldn't agree to its claims in the Pacific Northwest.

The 1859 ""pig dispute"" involved contested islands near Vancouver and the unfortunate shooting of a British hog that had intruded on an American's garden.

All that seemed the stuff of dusty history books, where the Grey Zone was a diplomatic oddity – an exception to a peaceful norm in the modern world of developed and integrated democracies.

But that calm is now broken, and no one is sure where these stormy waters will lead either country.

How does Canada's general election work? A simple guide,Canada is holding a national election amid growing tension with the US over trade and tariffs.,US & Canada,"Justin Trudeau, Canada election 2025, Mark Carney, Canada",BBC News,2025-03-10T09:00:05.476Z,2025-04-15T18:22:00.891Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cc04/live/c2464ad0-fa7c-11ef-896e-d7e7fb1719a4.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cc04/live/c2464ad0-fa7c-11ef-896e-d7e7fb1719a4.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwydlr3reqpo,"Mark Carney, former two-time central banker, was sworn in as Canada's new prime minister last month after being elected leader of the Liberal Party of Canada.

Shortly after, he called a snap general election.

Several political leaders had called for a vote after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced he was resigning as leader of the Liberals in January.

But after US President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on the country, sparking a trade war, calls grew for Canada to go to the polls as soon as possible.

With the snap election call, Carney is sending Canadians the polls in a matter of weeks.

The election will be held on Monday 28 April.

By law, the maximum time between federal elections in Canada is five years. The next vote was officially scheduled for 20 October 2025.

However, there are a couple of scenarios in which an early election can be triggered:

The first scenario is what Carney did last month.

In the Canadian federal election - as in the UK's general election - voters do not cast a ballot directly for a prime minister.

Instead, the leader of the party with the majority of members of parliament (MPs) becomes PM.

That means Carney will be in the running, along with Pierre Poilievre, who leads the opposition Conservative Party, and Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the New Democratic Party.

Four main parties will contest the next election - the Liberals, the Conservatives, the New Democrats (NDP) and the Bloc Quebecois.

The Liberal Party has been in power since 2015, when Trudeau was voted in. At dissolution, it held 153 seats.

The Conservatives were the official opposition with 120 seats.

The Bloc Quebecois, which only runs candidates in the province of Quebec, had 33 seats, and the NDP had 24.

The Green Party held two seats.

During the latter stages of Trudeau's premiership, opinion polls consistently showed the Conservatives with a strong lead.

But the numbers tightened after Trudeau stepped down.

Following Trump's decision to introduce steep tariffs against Canada, they tightened further, suggesting a neck-and-neck race.

By mid-April, national polls indicate the Liberals have a slight lead.

WhenTrudeau resigned at the beginning of 2025, he did so under significant pressure from his own party. It was felt that his personal unpopularity was damaging the Liberals' hopes of winning the next election.

National polling averages, shared by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), suggest how support for the Liberals weakened throughout 2023 and 2024.

At the same time, support for the Conservatives soared. On 20 January 2025 - the day of Trump's inauguration - the Conservatives were polling 44.8% while the Liberals were on 21.9%.

Since then, polls suggest that support for the Liberals has ticked back up. The latest averages indicate that - on a national average - slightly more than 40% of Canadians back the Liberals, while just under 40% support the Conservatives.

This marks the first time in three years the Liberals are leading in the polls.

How to respond to President Trump's economic threats has become a dominant issue for voters, along with the cost of living, the economy and the housing affordability crisis.

There are 343 federal ridings - also called constituencies or electoral districts -across the country. Each has a corresponding seat in the House of Commons.

All the seats in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, are up for grabs during an election.

Members of the Senate, the upper chamber, are appointed and do not run for election.

Like the UK, Canada has a ""first-past-the-post"" electoral system.

The candidate who gets the most votes in each riding wins that seat and become an MP. They do not need to get the majority of all the votes cast in their area. Other parties win nothing in that area.

The leader of the party with the largest number of elected MPs normally forms the government. The second-placed party usually forms the official opposition.

If no party ends up with an overall majority of seats, the result is known as a hung parliament or a minority government.

Practically, it means the party with the most seats will not be able to pass legislation without the help of other parties.

Who's who in Canada's federal election,Canadians will vote on April 28. Here is a breakdown of who could be the country's  next prime minister.,US & Canada,"Canada election 2025, Mark Carney, Canada",Nadine Yousif,2025-03-23T17:08:37.702Z,2025-04-16T14:55:22.186Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4789/live/c7fcbb30-0427-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4789/live/c7fcbb30-0427-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20l2evgny6o,"Canadians will head to the elections on 28 April, with polls suggesting a tight race between the ruling Liberals and the opposition Conservatives.

While Canadians don't vote for prime minister directly, the leader of the party that wins the most seats will traditionally become head of government.

It will be the first election in a decade without former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the ballot, and the frontrunners in the race are Liberal leader Mark Carney and leader of the Conservatives, Pierre Poilievre.

Here is a breakdown of the leaders of Canada's major political parties.

Carney, 60, is the incumbent prime minister of Canada, but he has only been on the job for a few weeks.

His party overwhelmingly chose him - with more than 85% of the vote - to succeed Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader in early March. He became prime minister shortly after, following Trudeau's resignation.

For many in Canada and the UK, Carney is a familiar face. He was head of both the Banks of Canada and England, serving at the former during the 2008 financial crash and the latter during Brexit.

He was born in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, making him the first Canadian prime minister from the north. Carney later grew up in Edmonton, Alberta, before he attended Harvard University and then Oxford, where he studied economics.

Carney is hailed for his financial expertise. He has also taken a defiant stance against US President Donald Trump, vowing retaliation against his tariffs and stating that Canada will never become the 51st US state.

But Carney is politically untested. He has never been elected to public office in Canada, and this general election will be his very first.

He is not as fluent in French as his opponents, though that has yet to be a liability among voters who feel strongly about preserving Canada's French-speaking heritage, especially in the province of Quebec.

He has faced some criticism for taking multiple breaks during the campaign - amid a trade war with the US - to focus on his role as prime minister.

Poilievre, 45, originally hails from Calgary, Alberta. He has been in Canadian politics for nearly two decades - first elected to the House of Commons at age 25, making him one of the youngest MPs at the time.

Since then, he has consistently advocated for a low-tax, small government in Canada.

He is known for his confrontational style of politics. In recent years, Poilievre tirelessly attacked the Liberals and Trudeau, saying that their ""disastrous"" and ""woke"" policies have worsened the quality of life in Canada, while promising a return to ""common sense politics"" if his party were to form government.

It is a message that has resonated with many Canadians who have been worried about the country's housing crisis, stagnant wages and high cost of living.

Poilievre led in national polls from mid-2023 until this March, and analysts had projected a near-certain win for his party in the upcoming election.

But a series of events - Trudeau's resignation, Trump's inauguration, and the rise of Carney as Liberal leader - has made this election a much tighter race.

Poilievre has been criticised for his populist style of politics and has drawn comparisons to Trump at a time when Canadians have rejected the US President's tariffs and his rhetoric that Canada should become the ""51st state"".

Poilievre has sought to shift his messaging, distancing himself from Trump and vowing to put ""Canada first"".

""I have a completely different story from Donald Trump,"" he said in a recent media appearance, highlighting his modest background.

Trump himself has said that Poilievre is not ""MAGA enough"", though the Conservative leader has been praised by Trump ally and tech titan Elon Musk.

The Bloc Québécois is a Quebec sovereignist party that only runs candidates in the French-speaking province, meaning its leader is unlikely to become Canada's next prime minister.

Still, they are a key player in Canadian elections, and their popularity in Quebec could determine the fate of the other major parties looking to form government.

Blanchet has led the party since 2019. He is known for his frankness, and has called Trump's 51st state rhetoric nonsense.

""It's enough jibber-jabber,"" Blanchet said during an address on Trump's tariffs last month in Montreal. ""We can say whatever we want, but that doesn't mean we can do whatever we want.""

On domestic issues, Blanchet has pushed for Quebec to diversify its trade partners, and has asked for a prominent seat at Canada's economic planning table.

He has said he wants Quebec to be a strong ally with Canada in trade talks with the US.

Quebec - with a large aluminium industry - has been hit hard by the US tariffs of 25%.

Still, polling indicates the Bloc - who went into the election with 33 seats in Parliament -  have been trailing behind the Liberal Party in Quebec.

CBC's poll trackersuggests the Liberals are polling at around 43% in the province, and the Bloc around 23%.

Blanchet has suggested that the appetite for an independent Quebec will ""come roaring back"" when and if the US-Canada relationship stabilises.

Singh, 46, is leader of the NDP, a left-leaning party that traditionally focuses on worker and labour issues. He made history in 2017 when he became the first ethnic minority and practicing Sikh to lead a major political party in Canada.

In 2019, the former criminal defence lawyer was elected as an MP in a British Columbia riding, where he has served in public office since.

The NDP had helped the Trudeau Liberal government keep its hold on power since 2021, providing needed votes in Parliament in exchange for support on progressive legislation like dental benefits for lower-income families and a national pharmacare programme covering birth control and insulin.

But in late 2024, Singh tore up that ""supply and confidence"" agreement, after Trudeau's cabinet directed its industrial relations board to impose binding arbitration to end a work stoppage at Canada's two largest railways.

At the time, Singh had said that the Liberals ""let people down"" and didn't ""deserve another chance from Canadians"".

But his party has struggled to shore up support. Polls suggest that only 8.5% of Canadians nationally intend to vote for them as of mid-April.

A big question will be whether the NDP will be able to retain the number of seats they occupy in the House of Commons and maintain official party status.

In the early 2010s, the party had enough support to form the official opposition, meaning it was the party with the second-most seats in Parliament. By 2021, their seat number had shrunk to 24 out of 338.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20l2evgny6o

The Insurrection Act of 1807 allows the president to use active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties inside the US.

US media report that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem, who were tasked with the assessment, will announce their recommendations later this week.

Since returning to office, Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a central focus, and border crossings have reached a quarter-century low. But the  statute could further expand the president's powers.

Here's what to know.

The 19th-century law would allow the use of active-duty military personnel to perform law-enforcement duties within the US.

This includes the National Guard - a branch of the US armed forces traditionally reserved for domestic emergencies and disasters.

US presidents can invoke the law if they determine that ""unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion"" against the government make it ""impracticable to enforce"" US law ""by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings"".

Once invoked, troops could be tasked with a range of duties, from quelling civil unrest and enforcing court orders to arresting and detaining migrants.

Because the Insurrection Act was written in broad terms, with little specific guidance on how and when the powers can be used, it gives presidents wide latitude in deciding when to mobilise military personnel for domestic operations.

Throughout his election campaign, Trump vowed to crackdown on illegal immigration, calling the southern border situation a ""national emergency"" that could be better tamed by invoking the 19th-century statute.

On his first day in office in January, he asked for ""recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807"".

The administration has already rolled out a series of sweeping measures targeting the border. These include a nationwide deportation sweep and the controversial move to transfer alleged Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador - a decision now facing legal challenges.

This comes as US Border Patrol has recorded just 8,300 migrant apprehensions, marking the lowest number of border crossings since 2000.



The Insurrection Act has been invoked a handful of times in American history.

Abraham Lincoln used it when the southern states rebelled during the US Civil War, and former President Ulysses S Grant invoked it against a wave of racist violence by the Ku Klux Klan after the war.

In the 20th century, former President Dwight D Eisenhower invoked it so the US Army would escort black students into their high school in Little Rock, Arkansas, after the state's governor refused to comply with a federal desegregation order.

More recently, it was used in 1992 when massive riots broke out in Los Angeles over the acquittal of four white police officers in the beating of Rodney King, a black man. Then-President George Bush sent in active-duty members of the Marines and Army as well as National Guard troops.

The US government has traditionally worked to limit the use of military force on American soil, especially against its own citizens.

The Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 was enacted to restrict the military from acting as domestic law enforcement. In times of unrest, states typically deploy the National Guard to help maintain order.

Since returning to office, Trump has expanded his authority by declaring national emergencies - a move that grants the presidency access to powers and resources that are normally restricted. He has used this authority to impose tariffs and, more controversially, to take action on immigration.

In March, following his emergency declaration at the border, Trump invoked therarely usedAlien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport migrants he alleged were gang members.  Earlier this month,the Supreme Court temporarily blockedthat effort.

If Trump chooses to invoke the Insurrection Act, it remains unclear what legal challenges he might face.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qwez9zz7jo
Inside the rural Texas town where Elon Musk is basing his business empire,The tycoon and Donald Trump adviser has moved his businesses from California to a mostly rural central Texas county.,US & Canada,"Elon Musk, Trump tariffs, Texas, United States",Mike Wendling,2025-04-19T23:15:43.002Z,2025-04-19T23:15:43.002Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1004/live/99e47f20-1daa-11f0-9644-3ba2ec84c20a.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1004/live/99e47f20-1daa-11f0-9644-3ba2ec84c20a.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9de28n71ldo,"After fleeing Silicon Valley for political and business reasons, Elon Musk is building a corporate campus in rural Texas – but his new neighbours have mixed views.

Half an hour east of Austin, past the airport, the clogged-up traffic starts to melt away and the plains of Central Texas open up, leaving the booming city behind.

Somewhere along the main two-lane highway, a left turn takes drivers down Farm-to-Market Road 1209. It seems like an unlikely address for a high-tech hub, but that's exactly what Elon Musk, the world's richest man and one of President Donald Trump's closest allies, hopes it will become.

Court filings indicate that a large metal building finished in the last few months will be the new headquarters of X, his social media platform.

A short distance away, a large logo of the Boring Company, Musk's infrastructure company, is plastered on the side of another headquarters.  And across FM 1209 is a rapidly growing SpaceX facility which manufacturesStarlink satellite internet equipment.

Like most technology tycoons, Musk had long made Silicon Valley his home and headquarters. Once a supporter of the Democrats, his move to Texas is part of a larger tech world trend and also appears to reflect his own transformed ideological views.

Here the land is (relatively) cheap, skilled tech workers from nearby Austin are plentiful, and local laws are favourable to development.

Of course, there are also specific political angles to the move.

In July 2024, Musk said he was quitting California after the state passed a law prohibiting teachers from enforcing rules about notifying families when students' gender identity changes.

Musk has anestranged transgender daughterand has spoken out against what he calls ""woke mind virus""-which he describes in interviews as divisive identity politics - along with anti-meritocratic and anti-free speech ideas.

And so Musk upped sticks and headed to Texas, a Republican stronghold and the fastest-growing state in the US.



In addition to the cluster of buildings near Bastrop in central Texas, he has built a SpaceX facility in Cameron County, on the southern tip of Texas near the border with Mexico. SpaceX employees there have filed a petition to create a new town called Starbase. The measure will go to a vote in May.

Locals in Bastrop have mixed feelings about the development.

""It's almost like we have a split personality,"" says Sylvia Carrillo, city manager of Bastrop, which has a growing population of more than 12,000. ""Residents are happy that their children and grandchildren will have jobs in the area.

""On the other hand it can feel like we are being overwhelmed by a third party and that the development will quickly urbanise our area,"" she says.

Although the Musk development is technically outside of the city's limits, it's close enough that Texas laws give Bastrop's government sway over development. And, Ms Carrillo stresses, the Musk buildings are just one example of many developments springing up in a booming area.

""He's faced a backlash that is not entirely of his own creating,"" she says.

""But now that he's here and things are changing quickly, it's a matter of managing"" issues like house and land prices and the environment, she says.

The Musk compound is still fairly bare-bones. The grandly named Hyperloop Plaza sits in the middle of the corporate buildings, and is home to the company-owned Boring Bodega, a bar, coffee shop, hairdresser and gift shop.

On a recent windy Sunday afternoon, a video game console sat unplayed in front of a couch near a display of company T-shirts, while a few children scurried back and forth to a playground outside.

The developments in Bastrop fit right into the quickening pace of activity across central Texas, where cranes perpetually loom above the Austin skyline and the housing market is a perpetual topic of conversation.

The area has gone through various industry booms and busts over the years, including lumber and coal mining, says Judy Enis, a volunteer guide at the Bastrop Museum and Visitor Center.

During World War Two, tens of thousands of soldiers - and around 10,000 German prisoners of war - poured in to Camp Swift, a US Army facility north of the town.

""That probably had more of an impact than Elon Musk,"" Ms Enis notes.

Views of the tycoon are mixed, to say the least, and inseparable not only from his politics but also opinions on economic development, in what still is a predominately rural area.

Judah Ross, a local real estate agent, says the development has supercharged population growth that started as a result of the Austin boom and accelerated during the Covid pandemic.

""I'm always going to be biased because I want the growth,"" Mr Ross says. ""But I love it here and I want to be part of it.

""If nothing else, what's good is the amount of jobs that this is bringing in,"" he says. ""In the past year,  I've sold to people working at Boring and SpaceX.""

Alfonso Lopez, a Texan who returned to the state after working in tech in Seattle, says he initially picked Bastrop figuring he would make a quick buck on a house purchase and move on.

Instead, he quickly became enamoured with the town, its mix of local businesses and friendly people, and wants to stay.



Mr Lopez is no big fan of Musk and is critical of some of his management practices and politics, but admires the technology his companies have built and is happy to live nearby as long as the companies are good neighbours.

""As long as they don't ruin my water or dig a tunnel beneath my house and create a sinkhole, this isn't bad,"" he says, gesturing around the metal shed housing the bodega, coffee shop and bar. ""I'll come here and watch a game.""

His concerns about water are more than theoretical. Last year The Boring Company was fined $11,876 (£8,950) by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality after being cited for water pollution violations.

The Boring Company initially planned to dump wastewater in the nearby Colorado River but, after local pressure, signed a deal to send the sludge to a Bastrop wastewater treatment plant.

The water issues appear to have delayed housebuilding, which reportedly could include more than 100 homes for Musk employees. The planned development of homes has so far failed to materialise, however. For now, the extent of living quarters is a handful of temporary trailers behind the bodega building, surrounded by a wall, acres of Texas plain and a few horses munching grass. Ms Carrillo, the city manager, says any large-scale home building is at least a year off.



In November, SpaceX applied for a free trade zone designation, which would allow it to move materials and finished products in and out of the Bastrop factory without being subject to tariffs - one of Donald Trump's signature policies.

It's a common practice for manufacturers, and there are hundreds of similar zones across the country.

Local officials in Texas have endorsed the proposal, saying it will boost the local economy, despite costing the county an estimated $45,000 (£34,800) in revenue this year.

The company is also getting an injection of $17.3m (£13.4m) from the Texas government to develop the site, a grant that officials say is expected to create more than 400 jobs and $280m in capital investment in Bastrop.

Few local residents wanted to directly criticise Musk when standing face-to-face with a visiting reporter. But it's a different story online, where sharper feelings shine through.

""They will ruin everything nearby,"" one resident posted on a local online forum. ""Nothing good comes with him.""



The BBC contacted SpaceX, The Boring Company and X for comment.

Ms Carrillo, the city manager, says she hasn't picked up on much personal anger on the part of locals prompted by Musk's activities in Washington.

But to protect Bastrop, she says, the city has recently enacted laws limiting housing density and providing for public parks - measures that she says will keep the ""historic nature"" of the well-preserved downtown while allowing for growth on the outskirts.

Bastrop, she says, is a conservative, traditionally Republican place.

""His national stuff doesn't really register,"" she says. ""His companies have been good corporate citizens, and we hope it can stay that way.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9de28n71ldo
Where UK country music might go next as pop's Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter explore the genre,"Since Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Lana Del Rey have explored country.",Newsbeat,"Country music, Manchester, Beyoncé, Music",Riyah Collins,2025-04-19T23:47:02.778Z,2025-04-19T23:47:02.778Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b806/live/d44ff390-1528-11f0-bc17-dfa4f8dfee61.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b806/live/d44ff390-1528-11f0-bc17-dfa4f8dfee61.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r88nxv1wyo,"They say the recipe for a good country track is simple - just combine three chords and the truth.

Over the past year though, a growing number of artists have been adding their own sprinkles with pop stars including Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter leaning into the genre.

Chappell's The Giver went straight to number two in the UK charts when it was released in March, with the self-proclaimed Midwest Princess saying she wanted to give country music a new take with ""a little gay yodel"".

Figures from streaming platforms suggest that cooking up a country song has also been a recipe for success, with listening time up by 25% over the past year in the UK.

British artists are hopeful that'll act as a giddy up to the UK scene and help them replicate some of the success of their US country cousins.

""It only benefits me and other country music artists in the UK because more people listening to country music just means they're going to take an interest - hopefully - in what we're doing,"" 20-year-old singer Neeve Zahra tells BBC Newsbeat.

Her love for country music comes from two sources: her grandad and Hannah Montana.

The Disney Channel school-girl-by-day-pop-star-by-night character played by Miley Cyrus ""probably started me off"", she says.

""I can now officially say I was country before country was cool.""

Neeve, from Manchester, is already noticing a spike in people coming to gigs and hopes the hype could build to a point where British country acts can be recognised with a category at the Brit Awards.

""That's definitely the dream.""

Izzie Walsh is currently recording her debut album and tells Newsbeat it's important fans support country artists ""at a grassroots level"" to ensure it can continue to grow in the UK.

""Everyone's been sleeping on it and now it's become this big thing.

""There's a lot of support for the big US artists and it can be hard to compete with that budget, the press.

""There's a big gap between people like me and these massive artists.""

In as far as a trend can ever be attributed to one person, this resurgence in the mainstream is ""100%"" down to Beyoncé, according to country music podcaster Matt Clewes.

Her 2024 album Cowboy Carter ""very much splits opinions with country fans"", Matt tells Newsbeat, but ""it has introduced new country artists to a country audience and gives a different perspective"".

Artists and critics predicted last yearCowboy Carter could ""open the floodgates""for country music fans and Spotify credits ""viral tracks"" from 2024 with the sudden uptick in streams.

But there's actually been a gradual increase in listenership going back much further it says, with streams of the genre in the UK growing by 154% since 2019, the year Lil Nas X released Old Town Road with country singer-songwriter Billy Ray Cyrus.

Apple Music says it's noticed similar trends and both streamers report its rising popularity is particularly striking in the UK, where according to Apple it's growing five times as quickly as in the US.

That's reflected in some of the biggest songs of the past year.

Sabrina Carpenter's country-pop hit Please, Please, Please, which she re-released with Dolly Parton, spent five weeks at number one in the UK and Shaboozey's A Bar Song was a fixture of the top 10 for months.

British country music is even set to be represented on one of the world's biggest stages next month thanks to the UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday.

""Storytelling is so important to us and that is really rooted in country music,"" singer Lauren Byrne tells Newsbeat about why the trio felt drawn to the genre.

""We never wanted to feel like we were trying to replicate or copy, we wanted to always make it feel our own.

""It doesn't all have to be 'yeehaw'.""

Matt says the next step will be to see British country artists headlining bigger festivals as the fan base continues to grow.

And as it does, he says it'll have to embrace the different points of view feeding into it.

Country is often associated with being dominated by male artists, but the musicians driving it into the mainstream are mainly women.

Last week Lana Del Rey joined Beyoncé, Chappell and Sabrina with her country song Henry, come on, but before them it was Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus and Shania Twain making country more popular.

""We're in the year of women in general for music,"" says Neeve. ""I think now it's time for the country women.""

As British country music grows, there are a few differences too with the traditional US scene that will also need embracing.

""We're often seen as, 'Why are they making country music? They don't live the country lifestyle',"" Matt says. ""We don't all live on farms, we don't all drive tractors.

""But country is all about storytelling and everyone wants to write their own story.

""It's evolving all the time so we have to be open to different styles and different perspectives.""

Neeve agrees that authenticity is the key to British country.

""It's about telling our own story,"" she says.

""I can dream about Nashville and maybe write some songs about it but I'm not gonna say I'm gonna pick you up in my truck because I don't have a truck.

""You've got to stay real to yourself. We try to keep it country but in our own way.""

Kilmar Abrego Garcia and MS-13: What is alleged and what we know,BBC Verify looks at the evidence behind allegations that the Salvadoran mistakenly deported to a mega-prison was a dangerous gang member.,World,"Immigration, El Salvador, US immigration, United States","Shayan Sardarizadeh, Merlyn Thomas, Jake Horton & Mike Wendling",2025-04-17T20:25:32.967Z,2025-04-19T01:47:52.438Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/123a/live/b996fec0-1bb0-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/123a/live/b996fec0-1bb0-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1k4072e3nno,"The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia - a 29-year-old from El Salvador who was deported from the US in March - has prompted a legal showdown over the administration's immigration policy.

Judges all the way up to the US Supreme Court have ruled that Mr Abrego Garcia was deported in error and that the US government should help ""facilitate"" his return to his home in Maryland.

But the White House has accused Mr Abrego Garcia of being a member of the transnational Salvadorian gang MS-13, a designated foreign terrorist organisation, saying that he ""will never live"" in the US again.

Mr Abrego Garcia denies he is a member of the gang and he has not been convicted of any crime.

BBC Verify has examined court documents and public records to determine what's known – and what is still unknown – about Mr Abrego Garcia and his alleged ties to MS-13.

Mr Abrego Garcia has acknowledged entering the US illegally in 2012,according to court documents.

In March 2019 he was detained along with three other people in Hyattsville, Maryland, in the car park of a Home Depot.

Officers at the Prince George's County Police Department said the men were ""loitering"" and subsequently identified Mr Abrego Garcia and two of the others as members of MS-13.

In a document titled the ""Gang Field Interview Sheet"", the local police detailed their observations.

They said Mr Abrego Garcia was wearing a ""Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie with rolls of money covering the eyes, ears and mouth of the presidents on the separate denominations"".

Officers claimed the clothing was ""indicative of the Hispanic gang culture"" and that ""wearing the Chicago Bulls hat represents thay (sic) they are a member in good standing with the MS-13"".

Steven Dudley, a journalist and author who has spent years studying the MS-13 gang, said that it is true that ""at some point, the Chicago Bulls logo with the horns became a stand-in of sorts for the MS-13's devil horns symbol"".

But wearing the logo of the hugely popular basketball team, he added, is of course not exclusive to the gang.

""Any assertions about gang affiliation would need to be corroborated with testimony, criminal history, and other corroborating evidence,"" Mr Dudley said.

According to the field interview sheet and other court documents, officers said they were also advised by a ""proven and reliable source"" that Mr Abrego Garcia was an active member of MS-13's ""westerns clique"", with the rank of ""chequeo"".

However, Mr Dudley says that a ""chequeo"" is not a rank but is instead used to refer to recruits who are yet to be initiated.

Lawyers for Mr Abrego Garcia'sargued in court filingsthat the ""westerns clique"" is based in New York, where they say their client has never lived. And according to government documents, he has dismissed the information given to police against him as ""hearsay"".

According to his lawyers, Mr Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of any criminal offence, including gang membership, in the US or in El Salvador. He lived in the US for 14 years, had three children and worked in construction, according to court records.

But the judge who presided over his 2019 casesaid that based on the confidential information, there was sufficient evidence to support Mr Abrego Garcia's gang membership. That finding was laterupheld by another judge.

As a result Mr Abrego Garcia was refused bail and remained in custody. During this time he applied for asylum to prevent his deportation to El Salvador.

In October 2019 he was granted a ""withholding of removal"" order,court documents show- a status different from asylum, but one which prevented the US government from sending him back to El Salvador because he could face harm.

Mr Abrego Garcia's lawyers say that he was granted the statusbased on his ""well-founded"" fear of persecutionby Barrio-18, the main rival gang of MS-13.

He said that prior to him entering the US, his family and their business had been threatened and extorted by Barrio-18.

Since 2019, when he was released with the protective order, Mr Abrego Garcia's lawyers say he has had yearly check-ins with immigration officials, which he has attended ""without fail and without incident"".

Two other allegations have surfaced since Mr Albrego Garcia was deported.

In 2021, his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, filed a protective order petition against him, alleging that he had physically attacked her on multiple occasions,according to documents shared by the US Department of Homeland Security.

Ms Vasquez Sura said in a statement on 16 April that she had decided not to follow through with the court process at the time and that she and her husband ""were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling"".

She described her husband as ""a loving partner and father"" and has repeatedly denied he is an MS-13 gang member.

On 15 April, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also accused Mr Abrego Garcia of involvement in human trafficking.

She appeared to be referencing a report in The Tennessee Star, a conservative news website, which claimed Mr Abrego Garcia was detained by a Tennessee highway patrol officer on suspicion of human trafficking in December 2022.

A report by the Department of Homeland Security said he was stopped for speeding and not staying in his lane.

There were eight other people in the car without luggage, the report said, which led the officer to suspect it could be a case of human trafficking.

However, there was no criminal case lodged against Mr Abrego Garcia.

""Kilmar worked in construction and sometimes transported groups of workers between job sites, so it's entirely plausible he would have been pulled over while driving with others in the vehicle,"" Ms Vasquez Sura said about the incident.

Anxiety on US college campuses as foreign students deported,"High-profile detentions and visa revocations are putting students on edge, as Trump tightens his squeeze on US schools.",US & Canada,"Israel-Gaza war, US immigration, Donald Trump, United States",Brandon Drenon and Robin Levinson-King,2025-04-18T23:36:45.012Z,2025-04-18T23:36:45.012Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b21a/live/723549e0-1ca2-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b21a/live/723549e0-1ca2-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xq5nd8jeo,"For the last few weeks, many foreign students living in the US have watched as a sequence of events has repeated itself on their social media feeds: plain-clothes agents appearing unannounced and hauling students off in unmarked cars to detention centres.

Those taken into custody in a string of high-profile student detentions captured on video have not faced any criminal charges and instead appear to have been targeted for involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses.

The Trump administration has said repeatedly that visas are a ""privilege"" and can be revoked at any time fora wide variety of reasons.

But the crackdown appears to be far wider than initially thought, with more than 1,000 international students or recent graduates at colleges across the US now having had their visas revoked or legal statuses changed, according to a tracker from Inside Higher Ed, an online news site covering the sector.

For many, the precise reasons are unknown, and universities have often only learned of the changes when checking a government-run database that logs the visa status of international students.

The combination of targeted detentions and reports of wide-scale visa revocations have left campuses on edge, from the biggest public universities to elite Ivy League institutions, students and faculty told the BBC.

""I could be next,"" said one student visa-holder attending Georgetown University, who has written articles about Israel and the war in Gaza.

He's begun carrying around a card in his pocket that lists his constitutional rights, in case he is ever stopped by law enforcement.

Another student in Texas said he's afraid to leave his apartment, even to buy groceries.

And at some colleges, departments are being hit as researchers abroad refuse to return to the US.

Most students the BBC spoke to requested anonymity out of fear that having their names in the media could make them a target.

The BBC has contacted theDepartment of Educationfor comment.

The reasons forvisa cancellations vary. In some cases, criminal records appear to be a factor. Other instances have reportedly included minor legal infractions like driving over the speed limit. But ""a lot"" of those targeted have been involved in pro-Palestinian protests, Secretary of State Marco Rubio himself has said.

It is part of awider White House pushto crack down on protesters whom officials say created an unsafe environment for Jewish students on many campuses. They also accuse demonstrators of having expressed support for Hamas, an officially designated terrorist group.

""Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,"" Rubio told reporters in late March. ""We do it every day.""

Civil liberties groups have protested against the detentions and moves to deport student demonstrators as a violation of constitutional rights. And the students themselves reject associations with Hamas, saying that they are being targeted for political speech about the war in Gaza and US support for Israel.

At Georgetown, signs that read ""protect our students"" have been taped to the doors of bathroom stalls, adding a sense of gloom to the cherry blossom trees and tulips that typically mark the arrival of spring on campus.

A postdoctoral fellow from the university,Badar Khan Suri, was grabbed by federal agents outside his Virginia home in March. The Department of Homeland Security  accused the conflict resolution researcher of ""promoting antisemitism on social media"" and having links to a ""known or suspected terrorist"".

This was an apparent reference to the Palestinian father of his US-born wife, a former adviser to killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh.

Mr Suri's lawyers say he has only met his father-in-law a handful of times and is being targeted due to his wife's identity.

His detention followed that of Columbia University student protest organiserMahmoud Khalil, a permanent resident arrested at home in New York but nowawaiting deportationfrom a facility in Louisiana.

Tufts University graduate studentRumeysa Ozturk, who co-authored a student newspaper op-ed about Gaza and was detained in Massachusetts, is also being held in Louisiana.

Last Monday,Mohsen Mahdawi, another Columbia student protester, was detained in Vermont as he attended an interview to obtain US citizenship. Like Mr Khalil, he holds a green card, rather than a student visa.

""Based on the detentions that we're seeing, I think there is a possibility anyone who has been outspoken about Palestine can be detained,"" said the Georgetown student, who knew Mr Suri.

The White House saysit is going after those who have been involved in activities that ""run counter"" to US national interests. In Mr Khalil's case, officials have cited a 1952 law that empowers the government to order someone deported if their presence in the country could pose unfavourable consequences for US foreign policy.

In a post on X, the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association celebrated Mr Khalil's arrest, calling him the ""ringleader of chaos"" at the university.

Polling suggests that immigration is an issue where President Trump enjoys some of his highest approval ratings, with recent Reuters and AP-NORC surveys suggesting about half of US adults approve of action in that area, several points higher than his overall rating.

Universities are also being targeted at an institutional level. This week, the White House's task force on combating antisemitism froze over $2bn in funding forHarvard University, after the university refused to agree to a list of demands that it said would amount to ""surrendering its independence"".

Trump officials have said that if Harvard doesn't comply with a request for information on certain student visaholders, it will stop granting visas to international students who want to study there.

Georgetown professor Nader Hashemi said he believes the government's main goal is ""silencing dissent"" by intimidating would-be protesters.

The Georgetown student says he has asked his parents not to fly from India to the US to see him graduate with a master's degree in just a few weeks. He is still unsure if he will even attend the ceremony.

In addition to checking his email daily to see if he is among the hundreds that have had their visas revoked recently, he has also prepared for the possibility of sudden arrest.

""I have cleared my chats across messaging apps, and I have learned how to quickly lock my phone in SOS mode,"" he said.

Georgetown professors have even begun offering spare rooms to students who worry about being visited by immigration agents at their residences, said Prof Hashemi.

""This is part of the trauma that I think students are facing,"" he said.

At Tufts University, outside of Boston, Massachusetts, students are waiting to see what happens to Ms Ozturk, who was detained outside her home.

Video showsher confused and shaking in fear as she is intercepted by agents while headed to a Ramadan dinner celebration. Last year, she had co-authored an op-ed supporting the boycott, divest and sanction (BDS) movement against Israel.

Tufts PhD student Anteri Mejr told the BBC that the actions have had a ""chilling effect"", and that international students she knows who have left the country to visit home or attend conferences are now afraid to return.

""There are students working remotely because they're afraid they can't get back in the country,"" he said.

At the University of Texas, rumours about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids on campus have some students terrified.

""I'm scared to be out. I'm scared to come to school. I'm scared to go grocery shopping,"" a master's student there said.

""I'm afraid that if I'm walking, I will be approached by agents in incognito clothes and plain disguise,"" he continued.

Despite being a green card holder and having not played a role in pro-Palestinian protests on campus, he says he is still in ""crippling anxiety"" because he has written things that are critical of the president.

""How far does this administration dig through, like, an immigrant's history?"" he asked. ""What if I did say something and I'm not aware.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xq5nd8jeo
Five takeaways from Canada party leaders' big TV debate,There were two ghosts in the room during Canada's federal election debate - Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump.,US & Canada,"Canada election 2025, Canada",Nadine Yousif in Toronto and Jessica Murphy in Montreal,2025-04-18T01:51:29.840Z,2025-04-18T20:21:22.526Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/219c/live/0773d440-1bfe-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/219c/live/0773d440-1bfe-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20x5xxe4wzo,"The leaders of Canada's four major federal parties have squared off in their second and final debate ahead of this month's general election.

But it was someone off stage who stole much of the spotlight - US President Donald Trump.

A big question heading into the two-hour forum was whether Liberal leader Mark Carney, who has been leading in the polls, would stumble.

Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, managed to survive Wednesday's French debate despite being less proficient in the country's second-most spoken language.

On Thursday, he found himself placed on the spot repeatedly by his three opponents: Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh and Bloc Québécois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet.

How to respond to Canada's ongoing trade war with the US was a theme, but the debate also saw clashes on affordability, crime and the environment.

Here are five big takeaways from Thursday's primetime showdown:

Carney's opponents were quick to focus on the mistakes of his unpopular predecessor, former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Conservative leader Poilievre made references to the ""lost Liberal decade"", talking about the last 10 years when the Liberal party has been in power. He cited issues like housing affordability and the high cost of living to drive his point home.

""How can we possibly believe that you are any different?"" Poilievre asked Carney.

Blanchet also threw down the gauntlet to Carney. ""You claim you are different - you need to prove you are better.""

Carney was forced to defend himself multiple times, noting that he has only been in the prime minister's chair for one month despite sharing the same party banner as Trudeau.

""I am a very different person than Justin Trudeau,"" Carney said.

The leaders were asked about how they would negotiate with Trump and respond to his tariffs on Canada.

The US president has implemented blanket 25% tariffs on goods from Canada, with an exemption on products covered by the USMCA - a North American free trade deal. Canada is also hit with global US tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars.

The president has also publicly spoken about Canada becoming the 51st US state.

Canada's government has previously said its position is to implement ""dollar-for-dollar"" tariffs with the aim of inflicting maximum pain on the US economy.

But during the debate, the leaders appeared to concede it is ultimately not an equal fight.

""We've moved on from dollar-for-dollar tariffs,"" Carney said, acknowledging that the US economy is more than 10 times the size of Canada's.

The Liberal leader said the focus would shift to targeted tariffs designed to maximise pain on the US and hurt Canada as little as possible.

Trump appears to have softened his language on Canada in recent weeks. After a phone call with the US president in late March, Carney said Trump ""respected Canada's sovereignty"" and that their conversation was ""constructive"".

Canada and the US are expected to start talks on trade and security after the 28 April election.

For Canadians tuned in to issues facing the country beyond Trump and his tariffs, the debate offered substantive policy discussions on topics from housing to crime to immigration.

It was clear that Canadians have starkly different choices before them.

Poilievre frequently championed his vision of a small government that would keep taxes low to drive up economic growth and affordability for Canadians, and that would be tough on crime.

Singh, meanwhile, pushed for stronger social programmes in Canada, including expanding the country's national dental care and pharmacare programmes and other healthcare spending.

Carney stuck close to the centrist point of view of his party.

""Government can play a role, but its role has to be catalytic,"" he said during a segment on strong leadership in a crisis.

Canada's political system, similar to that of the UK, has several political parties - the centrist Liberals, the right-leaning Conservatives, the left-leaning New Democrats, and the Bloc, which only runs candidates in Quebec.

There is also the Green Party, which was disqualified at the last minute from the debate for not running enough candidates.

But polls suggest that in this election, the bulk of Canadians are opting to support either the Conservatives or the Liberals.

This has left the third-place parties fighting for survival. National polls have Singh's New Democrats polling at 8.5% - which could roughly translate to just five seats out of 343, a major loss from their current 24 seats.

Singh pushed to make his voice heard, repeatedly interrupting both Poilievre and Carney in a bid to set his party apart as the choice for left-wing voters.

""You can't entrust all the power to Mr Carney,"" Singh remarked.

Meanwhile, Bloc leader Blanchet inserted issues relevant to the French-speaking province at every opportunity.

His party, too, stands to lose at least a dozen seats in Quebec, according to current polling.

Despite the frequent crosstalk, the tone overall was rather cordial.

The general sense of decorum was apparent when the leaders were discussing the housing crisis. In a rebuttal to Poilievre, Carney appeared to stop himself before laying into his opponent.

""A misunderstanding... ,"" Carney said as he paused mid-sentence, adding: ""I'll be polite.""

Even after some heated exchanges, Carney and Poilievre were filmed shaking hands and laughing afterwards.

Not only was it strikingly different to some recent presidential debate cycles in the US, it was even friendlier than some past Canadian federal debates.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20x5xxe4wzo
Canada's 'regular' homes now cost millions. Can a new government fix it?,"Housing has taken a backseat in Canada's election to Donald Trump's tariffs, but advocates argue the affordability crisis is just as disruptive.",US & Canada,"Housing, Canada election 2025, British Columbia, Canada",Nadine Yousif,2025-04-18T00:06:48.923Z,2025-04-18T00:06:48.923Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b557/live/83ad2730-1a34-11f0-b287-9bbf4848835b.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b557/live/83ad2730-1a34-11f0-b287-9bbf4848835b.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy70y75v5l7o,"Before Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and threatened its sovereignty, the Canadian psyche was consumed with another major issue: housing affordability. With an election on the horizon, voters are wondering if any party has a plan to fix what has become a generational problem.

Willow Yamauchi says she was just a ""regular"" person when she and her husband bought their family home in Vancouver 25 years ago for a modest sum of C$275,000 - around C$435,000 ($312,000; £236,400) in today's dollars.

That same property is now worth several million.

In the city on Canada's west coast, Ms Yamauchi's story is as common as the rainy weather. The average price of a detached home in Vancouver in 2000 was around C$350,000. Now, it is more than C$2m.

""My husband and I were very privileged to be able to purchase a house when we did,"" the 52-year-old writer tells the BBC. As a member of Generation X, timing was on her side.

The same, she says, cannot be said for younger people, who - without ""the bank of mom and dad"" - are effectively priced out of the city they grew up in.

Vancouver, a cultural and economic hub with a population of less than one million, is often seen as the epicentre of Canada's housing crisis. A report byChapman University in California last yearlisted it among the top ""impossibly unaffordable"" cities in the world.

But it is not the only Canadian city where the cost of homes is out of reach for many. Canada as a whole has one of the highest house-price-to-income ratios among developed nations.

In 2021, the average household income after taxes in Canada was around C$88,000, according to national data. That same year, the average home price hit C$713,500 - more than eight times higher. The gap is even larger in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver.

For many Canadians, housing isone of the top issues in the federal election, eclipsed only recently by US President Donald Trump and his tariffs on Canada.

Before Trump, concerns on housing affordability had boosted the Conservative Party, which has consistently been seen as the best equipped to fix the crisis.

But then a trade war with the US came along and it catapulted the governing Liberal party to the top of the polls.

Even with the Trump factor, the topic featured prominently in the two election debates this week. During the French language one, moderator and journalist Patrice Roy displayed figures showing how much home prices had increased in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver in the last decade.

""I'm sure this won't come as a surprise,"" Mr Roy told the federal leaders, before asking for their plans on how they would fix the crisis.

Polls show young people are especially worried about the housing crisis and what it means for their future.

Speaking to students at the University of British Columbia's (UBC) Vancouver campus, it quickly became clear that the issue was top of mind for many.

Many said they have either opted to live at home during their studies to save on costs, or are paying anywhere from C$1,100 to C$1,500 for a single room near campus, often in a home shared with five or six others.

Emily Chu, a 24-year-old who is in her final semester at UBC, says that she at one point had to delay her studies by two years in order to work, as she struggled to afford paying both tuition and rent.

She now shares an apartment with her older brother, who works full-time and pays the majority of the rent. Ms Chu considers herself one of the lucky ones.

As for home ownership in the future, she says ""that's not even possible"" for most people her age. ""Everybody kind of assumes that we can't ever own housing.""

Young professionals with well-paying jobs, like Margareta Dovgal, are also priced out. The 28-year-old director at Vancouver-based non-profit Resource Works told the BBC that she has considered moving to the neighbouring province of Alberta due to its lower cost of living, despite being a lifelong and ""committed Vancouverite"".

Still, Calgary, Alberta's largest city, sawhouse prices increase by 15% in 2024 from the previous yearas the city experienced itshighest population growth ratesince 2001.

The root causes of Canada's housing affordability crisis are complex. One of the main issues is a supply that has not kept up with a growing population, which has driven up costs for both buyers and renters.

The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the national housing agency, estimates that more than 3.8 million homes need to be built in the next six years to address the shortage.

Construction of new housing, however,has been well below that target, raising questions on whether Canada will meet this goal. Experts say barriers to ramping up building include the high cost and scarcity of land in urban areas, where most Canadians tend to live and work.

There are also regional barriers, like city zoning laws that prevent the construction of more affordable, higher density housing - including apartment buildings or multiplexes - in some neighbourhoods.

Daniel Oleksiuk, co-founder of the advocacy group Abundant Housing Vancouver, says his city is one example, where more than half of the land has historically been zoned for single-family homes.

""We've kept almost all of the land reserved,"" Mr Oleksiuk told the BBC. ""There are whole neighbourhoods where all you have is three to five million dollar homes.""

On the campaign trail, each major federal party has put forward a plan to fix the crisis, all with the goal of building as many homes as quickly as possible.

The Liberals, led by Mark Carney, said their aim is to build 500,000 new homes a year with the help of a new government agency called Build Canada Homes that would oversee and finance the construction of affordable housing in Canada - a plan similar to one implemented after the Second World War to house veterans.

Critics have questioned whether Carney's target is viable, as it would require Canada to more than double its current construction rate.

Meanwhile, the Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, vowed to tie federal funding to housing starts by rewarding cities that build more homes and penalising those that block construction - a carrot-and-stick approach.

Poilievre also promised to remove federal taxes on newly constructed homes in an effort to cut costs to would-be homebuyers. Critics, however, say this policy may have minimal effect, as most homes purchased in Canada are resold, rather than brand new.

Voters who spoke to the BBC say they welcome any plan to ramp up housing construction in Canada.

While much of housing is governed by provinces and cities, Ms Dovgal notes that the federal government has an ability ""to lead persuasively"" and implement measures that make it cheaper and easier to build across the country.

But others watching the issue closely caution that the steps proposed may not be enough.

Paul Kershaw, a public policy professor at UBC and founder of think tank Generation Squeeze, argues that politicians have failed to address the elephant in the room: the wealth older homeowners have generated off the housing crisis.

""The political bargain has asked younger Canadians to suffer higher rents and mortgages in order to protect those higher home values,"" Kershaw notes.

""None of the parties are really naming that generational tension,"" he says, adding that politicians may privately feel there is a political risk in trying to stall the cost of housing, and thus, older Canadians' assets.

Prof Kershaw calls this a ""cultural problem"", and says that parties should also focus on reducing costs for younger people as a way to alleviate this generational burden.

Fixing the housing crisis, he argues, is just as integral as asserting sovereignty and prosperity in the face of threats posed by Trump's tariffs.

The ""dysfunction that has entered our housing market is disruptive to the well-being of the country"", he says.

Until a fix is found, the possibility of homeownership still looks bleak for many.

Ms Dovgal contends half-heartedly that, other than moving elsewhere, ""you have to win the lottery, or marry a multi-millionaire. These are kind of the options"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy70y75v5l7o
Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff 'thought he had died' in Top Gear crash,Cricketer-turned-TV host Andrew 'Freddie' Flintoff opens up about his car crash for the first time.,Culture,"Television, BBC, Top Gear, Andrew Flintoff",Ian Youngs,2025-04-23T23:34:50.540Z,2025-04-23T23:34:50.540Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/90ef/live/d00c17f0-2063-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/90ef/live/d00c17f0-2063-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgzy8wy72o,"Andrew Flintoff has given his first account of the car crash he was in while filming Top Gear, saying he thought he ""was dead"" in the immediate aftermath.

The England cricketer-turned-TV presenter sustained serious facial and rib injuries when the three-wheeler car he was driving for the BBC motoring programme rolled over in 2022.

Speaking in a new Disney+ documentary, 'Freddie' Flintoff said that despite the trauma, he ""remembers everything about it"".

""I thought I was dead, because I was conscious but I couldn't see anything,"" he recalled.

""I was thinking, is that it? Is that it? You know what I mean? Just black for the rest of my days?

""My hat came over my eyes - so I pulled my hat up and I thought, no I'm not [dead], I'm on the Top Gear track, this is not heaven.""

Flintoff then looked down to see blood, and said his ""biggest fear"" was that he no longer had a face left.

""I thought my face had come off. I was frightened to death.""

He recalled being in ""agony"" for between half an hour and 40 minutes until an air ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.

The incident took place on 13 December 2022 at Top Gear's test track at Dunsfold Park Aerodrome in Surrey.

He was driving an open-topped Morgan Super 3 when it flipped and slid, dragging him along the track during filming.

Speaking in the documentary, he described how time seemed to slow down as the car rolled over, and how his quick reactions as a cricketer allowed him to move his head in an attempt to avoid even worse injuries.

""As it started going over, I looked at the ground and I knew, if I get hit here on the side [of the head] then I'll break my neck, or if I get hit on the temple I'm dead. The best chance is to go face down.

""And then I remember hitting [the ground] and my head got hit,"" he added. ""But then I got dragged out, and the car went over, and I went over the back of the car, and then [I got] pulled face down on the runway about 50m underneath the car. And then I hit the grass and then [it] flipped back.""

Surgeon Jahrad Haq, who treated Flintoff, told the documentary the injuries were ""very complex"" - a mixture of hard and soft tissue injuries, broken teeth, lost teeth and elements of the upper jaw bone that were also fractured and displaced.

He ""lost a really significant portion of his upper lip - the skin and some of the underlying muscle - and also his lower lip,"" he said.

Mr Haq said the injuries were in the ""top five"" in terms of severity of those he had seen during his career.

Reflecting on the recovery, Flintoff said he ""didn't think I had it in me to get through"" the ordeal.

""This sounds awful. Part of me wishes I'd been killed. Part of me thinks I wish I'd died,"" he added.

""I didn't want to kill myself. I don't want to mistake the two things. I was not wishing, but thinking, this would have been so much easier...

""Now I try to take the attitude, you know what, the sun will come up tomorrow, and then my kids will still give me a hug, and I'm probably in a better place now.""

One of England's most successful cricketers, Flintoff previously said he is ""loving"" his return to the sport coaching England Lions - the development squad underneath England Men's cricket team.

Flintoff's wife Rachael told the documentary his return to the sport was crucial on the road to recovery.

""When Andrew needed it most, cricket was there for him,"" she said. ""It sounds a bit weird saying it, a bit over the top to say, but I do think cricket saved him. It gave him a reason for being, again.""

The 47-year-old also returned to television last year with a second series of his BBC programme Freddie Flintoff's Field of Dreams, which saw him take a team of young cricketers from his hometown of Preston on a tour of India, a year after his crash.

The acclaimed series is up for a Bafta Television Award in the factual series category next month.

He also hosted a reboot of darts game show Bullseye over Christmas, which will return for a full series later this year.

In 2023, the BBC ""rested"" Top Gear for the foreseeable future. A financial settlement was also reached with Flintoff.

The documentary, titled Flintoff, is on Disney+ from Friday, 25 April.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgzy8wy72o
Kirsty Wark: Broadcaster to receive prestigious Bafta fellowship,The former Newsnight presenter will collect the award at the TV Baftas in May.,N/A,"Television, Bafta Awards, Journalism",Emma Saunders,2025-04-24T11:03:48.160Z,2025-04-24T11:03:48.160Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4643/live/f6bef1c0-1f7c-11f0-acbf-41bf5b8e34ef.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4643/live/f6bef1c0-1f7c-11f0-acbf-41bf5b8e34ef.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yw3yw9jko,"Presenter and journalist Kirsty Wark is to receive the Bafta fellowship, the British Academy's highest honour.

The award recognises industry figures who have made an outstanding contribution to film, television or games.

Wark, who presented BBC's Newsnight programme for 30 years until leaving last July, said: ""This is a wonderful surprise and a great honour. Television has been my home for 40 years... I continue to learn every day from people with awe-inspiring skills who have become treasured colleagues and dear friends.""

The news comes after it was revealed that EastEnders has been named recipient of the 2025 Bafta TV craft special award for its commitment to taking on and nurturing new talent off-screen.

The BBC One soap was praised for its work on nurturing upcoming directors from under-represented groups, and offering writing and acting opportunities on its spin-off show, E20, which ran for three series.

Scottish broadcaster Wark finds herself in good company among previous fellowship recipients, including Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg, Dame Judi Dench, Dame Vanessa Redgrave, Martin Scorsese, Sidney Poitier and Dame Helen Mirren.

The most recent winners are actor and presenter Warwick Davis and composer Yoko Shimomura.

Jane Millichip, CEO of Bafta, said: ""Kirsty's dedication is unwavering when it comes to telling the stories that really matter.""

She praised Wark's legacy, adding it is ""unmatched in the world of news and current affairs broadcasting"", along with her ""ability to inform and engage her readers, listeners and viewers"".

""She does all this with enormous charm and wit,"" she added.



Wark was described as a ""legend of British journalism"" by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair during her final Newsnight show in July 2024, while former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told her: ""To say you are a broadcasting titan... would be an understatement. It's hard to imagine that landscape without you.""

Wark spent more than 30 years presenting the long-running politics show but has remained working at the BBC, continuing to present Radio 4's The Reunion, Start the Week and Front Row on Radio 4.

In September, she presented a Panorama special on the menopause industry, while last month, she fronted a two-part documentary on Scottish fashion called Icons of Style.

She's also been working on her third novel.

Wark joined the BBC as a graduate researcher in 1976 for BBC Radio Scotland, going on to become a producer in radio current affairs.

After a spell on Radio 4's The World At One, she moved to television in 1983. She worked as a producer on Reporting Scotland.

She was one of the first television journalists to arrive on the scene when Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up above Lockerbie in 1988.

Two years later, she famously locked horns with Margaret Thatcher in a headline-making interview which propelled her into the national spotlight.

She joined BBC Two's arts strand The Late Show as a presenter and then moved on to Newsnight in 1993.

Her many famous interviewees over the years include George Clooney, ex-US president Bill Clinton, Damien Hirst, Madonna and Harold Pinter.

Race Across the World strengthens Sussex sisters' sibling bond,Two sisters from West Sussex are among five teams competing in the BBC reality show.,Sussex,"Television, Travel",Craig Buchan,2025-04-24T13:51:43.688Z,2025-04-24T13:51:43.688Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3dab/live/0a5f0520-2113-11f0-8c58-0f3e2186d95e.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3dab/live/0a5f0520-2113-11f0-8c58-0f3e2186d95e.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xl0v11ggo,"Two sisters competing in Race Across the World have said taking part in the tough contest has strengthened their sisterly bond.

Elizabeth and Letitia, from West Sussex, are racing four other teams from China to India in the fifth series of the reality show, which launched on BBC1 on Wednesday.

""Doing it like this is something unexpected, unimaginable, and a once in a lifetime opportunity,"" Elizabeth told BBC Radio Sussex.

""It was a different way of trying to bond with a sibling, for sure,"" added the 33-year-old.

Letitia, 26, admitted that they ""didn't really take it so seriously"" when they applied to take part in the programme, but were soon wondering if they were capable of completing the race.

""We watched it before and I thought 'we can do that, we like to travel',"" added Elizabeth.

""But actually doing it and being together 24/7, trying to make decisions together, is a different story.""

The contest sees the teams travel more than 8,700 miles (14,000km), starting from the Great Wall of China and traversing China, Nepal, and India without flights or smartphones.

Contestants can only spend the cash equivalent of an airfare between the start and finish points, but the winners take home a £20,000 prize.

""Every day we were surprising ourselves, just being put in situations where you had to make difficult decisions,"" said Letitia.

She added that, although the pair are ""very different"", they were able to use this to their benefit in the race.

""We complemented each other along the way,"" she said.

""But sometimes, while we were going along, some of the differences did bring some conflict that we had to deal with.""

Police watchdog complains to Ofcom over BBC's Panorama on Chris Kaba ,The Chris Kaba episode initially aired without the IOPC's response to claims made by an ex-employee.,UK,"Chris Kaba shooting, Metropolitan Police Service",Paul Glynn,2025-04-24T11:58:18.293Z,2025-04-24T11:58:18.293Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8263/live/80dffa80-20e4-11f0-9b17-b99e39a28c13.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8263/live/80dffa80-20e4-11f0-9b17-b99e39a28c13.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr783gxve9go,"A police watchdog has complained to Ofcom over an episode of Panorama about the shooting of Chris Kaba.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) went to the broadcasting watchdog after its request for a public apology from the BBC went unmet, after the programme initially aired without including the IOPC's statement in response toclaims made by its own former regional director Sal Naseem.

A BBC spokeswoman said the corporation's own Executive Complaints Unit (ECU)rulinghad judged the complaint to be ""resolved"" after it had been accepted as an oversight not to include the IOPC's point of view; the iPlayer version and online article were quickly amended.

Mr Kaba was shot dead after he tried to ram his way out of a police vehicle stop in south London in September 2022.

Sgt Martyn Blake, an officer in the specialist firearms unit MO19, was found not guilty of murder in October last year, prompting protests from the Kaba family.

Speaking after the verdict at the Old Bailey, Mr Kaba's family said it was ""painful proof that our lives are not valued by the system"".

Mr Naseem told BBC Panorama that in his opinion, he had not been convinced that Mr Kaba presented a sufficient danger to justify being shot.

He suggested that the murder investigation into Mr Blake was launched amid pressure over potential unrest, which is denied by the IOPC.

The IOPC complained that the programme did not make clear that Mr Naseem no longer works for the watchdog, and that it was not given the proper right to reply to the claims over why the investigation was launched.

In the programme, Mr Naseem said that when the IOPC launched its homicide investigation four days after the shooting, ""It was fed back to us... that if we hadn't done it at that time then it's likely there would have been a level of disorder.""

The IOPC's statement denying this was added to the iPlayer version of the Panorama episode and online news stories.

The statement read: ""The decisions to criminally investigate Sergeant Blake, and then refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), followed careful consideration of a significant amount of evidence gathered during our independent investigation and by applying the relevant legal tests which govern our work.""

According to the BBC complaint unit's judgement, Panorama should have provided the IOPC with specific information about the claims to be made about it, and therefore found an element of unfairness to the IOPC.

However it noted the programme makers had taken subsequent action to include the organisation's right to reply in the iPlayer version and related online article, which was deemed ""sufficient to resolve this aspect of the complaint.""

But the IOPC said on Thursday it had complained to Ofcom because it was ""hugely dissatisfied that, despite admitting these two breaches of its own guidelines, the BBC has steadfastly refused to apologise publicly despite the IOPC providing evidence to show the serious reputational damage caused to the organisation as a result of the programme.

""In particular, the suggestion within that programme, that the IOPC was pressured to start a homicide investigation, was wrong and resulted in public criticism from a number of media organisations and individuals including concerns raised by the London Assembly and local councillors about the IOPC's independence and motivations.

""Had we been aware this would be suggested, we would have strongly refuted it.""

Mr Naseem said in the Panorama that he fully accepted the jury's verdict, but stood by the IOPC's decision to refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).

Race Across the World 'much harder' than Suffolk duo expected,Caroline and Tom say a language barrier and lack of modern tech make things tricky.,Suffolk,"Television, Reality TV, Bury St Edmunds",Aimee Dexter,2025-04-24T12:59:15.314Z,2025-04-24T12:59:15.314Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/36b6/live/cd291d00-20f7-11f0-b122-c52cf00da345.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/36b6/live/cd291d00-20f7-11f0-b122-c52cf00da345.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c33zj3nk73do,"A man who took part in the latest series of Race Across the World with his mother said the experience was ""much harder than we thought it would be"".

Caroline and Tom, who live in Hargrave near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, are one of five pairs competing in the fifth series of theBBC programme.

The teams started their journey at The Great Wall of China and have to travel across three countries to become the first across the finish line, in a bid to win £20,000.

Tom, 21, said: ""We didn't have any phones, and the language barrier was just impossible. It was so much harder than we thought it would be.""

The programme sees the teams race through about 8,700 miles (14,000 km) of Asia, through China, Nepal, and India.

The aim is to be the first contestants to reach the finish line at the southernmost tip of India, in Kanyakumari, without using smartphones, bank cards or flights.

Caroline, 60, said: ""I knew it was what I wanted - it was as if the programme was made for me.""

She said she was ""so excited"" to be told they had been selected to take part, and rang her son within seconds.

""From that moment in time it changed our lives,"" she added.

The pair had told their family and friends they were travelling around Australia for two months whilst they were filming for the series.

Tom said: ""The hardest thing was when we came back everyone was like 'how was Australia', and obviously we had not been, so it was hard to describe it.""

Tom had previously travelled around South America and Europe for a combined time of about 10 months, but his mother has never had the opportunity.

Caroline said the experience was ""life changing"" and it was a ""fantastic feeling"" to travel without a phone.

Her son added: ""It has given me a better understanding of the world, and a bit more confidence in myself.""

Paddington musical: McFly's Tom Fletcher reveals details of new stage show,"The McFly star says he is ""so lucky and honoured"" to have written the music and lyrics for the new show.",Culture,"Theatre, Film, Paddington Bear",Steven McIntosh,2025-04-24T04:57:52.015Z,2025-04-24T04:57:52.015Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b329/live/01b69810-2033-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b329/live/01b69810-2033-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c793l125gwvo,"McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt ""overwhelming excitement"" working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November.

The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would ""do Paddington proud"", adding that the musical numbers are ""my favourite songs I've ever written"".

The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.

The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.

Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt ""so honoured and lucky"" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect ""all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly"".

""There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,"" he joked.

Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.

He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the showwas formally announced in 2023.

With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature ""lots of juicy new material"".

""We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,"" she said.

""Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.""

Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.

The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.

Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what ""the musical language"" of Paddington was. ""Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,"" he explained.

He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with ""a very fast 'yes please'"", but began writing music for the show right away.

""While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.""

He reflected: ""My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.""

The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.

In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.

It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.

""I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!"" joked Swale. ""He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!""

She continued: ""I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.""



Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for ""really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it”, adding: “Every single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.

""I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.""

As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical ""also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington"".

""For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.""

Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be ""fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right"".

He added: ""I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.""

The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, ""so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in"", he explained.

""It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.""

Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.

""You can rest easy,"" laughed Swale. ""Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c793l125gwvo

The star, 23, is now among only a handful of K-pop artists who have come out publicly.

Bain made the announcement in front of fans while performing a solo at a concert in Los Angeles on Tuesday night.

The moment was met with loud cheers from the crowd, according to videos circulating on social media.

""To anyone out there who's part of the LGBT community, or still figuring it out - this is for you guys,"" Bain, whose real name is Song Byeong-hee, said in avideoposted on his social media after the concert.

""You are seen, you are loved, and you were born this way,"" he added, before launching into a performance of Born This Way by pop icon Lady Gaga, whom he referred to as ""my queen"".

His bandmates welcomed the announcement. Just B member Siwoo said he cried while watching Bain's performance. ""I know how hard it was for him, and that made me want to cry more,"" he said, according to Korean media outlet News1.

The band's fans have shown their support as well. ""We love you so much and are so proud of you for being yourself,"" reads a top-liked comment under his Instagram post.

""You are so loved. So proud to be your fan. Be proud of who you are,"" another fan wrote.

Formed in 2021, Just B is a six-member act that has released five EPs and multiple singles.

Coming out remains extremely rare in South Korea's highly-pressurised entertainment industry. While homosexuality is not illegal in the country, it remains taboo, and same-sex marriage is not legally recognised.

A 2022 Human Rights Watch report described discrimination against LGBT people in South Korea as ""pervasive"".

Bain is not the first K-pop star to come out. Just last month, Lara, an Indian-American member of the girl group Katseye, came out as queer on a K-pop fan community platform. In 2020, Jiae from the now-disbanded girl group Wassup announced on Instagram that she is bisexual.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6jzd6g9nwo

Plans for the Dark Till Dawn Prom were unveiled in the programme announcing the summer festival, which will also feature one-handed pianist Nicholas McCarthy, rock star St Vincent and a celebration of film composer Bernard Herrmann.

The ever-popular CBeebies Prom will return, and Claudia Winkelman will host a concert exploring the tense and haunting soundtrack to the hit TV show The Traitors.

Highlights of the classical repertoire include Shoshtakovich's opera Lady Macbeth, and Korean sensation Yunchan Lim playing Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No 4.

On 5 September, Sir Simon Rattle will conduct Chineke! - Europe's first minority Black and ethnically diverse orchestra - for the first time.

Their concert will include a performance of the final work by Pulitzer-winning US composer George Walker, which was written as a response to the2015 Charleston church shooting.

Other stars gracing the 2025 season include soprano of the moment Aigul Akhmetshina, making her Proms debut, violinist Randall Goosby, sitar virtuoso Anoushka Shankar, Pakistani-American singer Arroj Aftab, and Grammy award-winner Angelique Kidjo.

There will be 86 concerts in all, with a number taking place in Gateshead, Bristol, Bradford, Belfast and Sunderland.

Tickets go on sale at 9am on 17 May. On-the-day ""Promming"" tickets are £8 including booking fees, and seated tickets start from £10 plus booking fees.

The all-nighter, on 8 August, is being planned by organist Anna Lapwood, who said the idea had been several years in the making.

""I spend a lot of time at the Albert Hall in the middle of the night, practicing, and I find it fascinating that the building is still just running overnight,"" she says.

""There are always people there - cleaners and security guards - a bit like A Night At The Museum.

""So we talked about how fun it would be to be able to invite people into that space, both physically, but also the abstract space of being in an iconic building in the middle of the night.""

Her programme will include YouTube pianist Hayato Sumino, Russian cellist Anastasia Kobekina and Norwegian ensemble Barroksolistene, whose ""Alehouse sessions"" aim to recreate the atmosphere of a 17th Century English tavern.

Lapwood says the artists are all connected by an enthusiasm for ""messing around"" with music, citing Sumino's viral video of the ""seven degrees of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"".

""There are various moments where we're hoping to do some collaborations,"" she reveals. ""But the logistics of this are all very, very complicated, not least trying to figure out everyone's sleep schedules!""

This summer's season is the first since the departure of Proms director David Pickard. He has been replaced by Hannah Donat who, as director of artistic planning, had shaped the festival alongside the controller of BBC Radio 3, Sam Jackson.

""I think of the Proms as the classical music equivalent of Wimbledon,"" she says.

""Everyone likes to go to Wimbledon, even if they don't watch tennis for the rest of the year; and everyone likes to go to a Prom, even if they're not going to concerts for the rest of the season.""

""It gives the concerts a warmth and an informal atmosphere.

""People don't worry too much about knowing the repertoire inside out - there's just something spectacular about the Albert Hall and seeing the orchestra onstage.""



Among the concerts to watch out for are:

19 July: The Great American Songbook and Beyond with Samara Joy. Fresh from winning best jazz album at this year's Grammys, US singer Samara Joy teams up with the BBC Concert Orchestra for a night of standards by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holliday.

20 July: Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand. The world's only professional one-handed concert pianist, Nicholas McCarthy, makes his Proms debut, playing a concerto originally written for Paul Wittgenstein, after he lost his right arm during World War One.

26 July: The Traitors.""I've asked for a cloak and an owl,"" says Claudia Winkelman, ahead of this one-off concert, featuring classical pieces ""with betrayal at their heart"" alongside the gothic re-workings of pop songs heard in the TV reality show.

2 August: Mahler's Resurrection Symphony. Canadian mezzo-soprano Emily D'Angelo, whose voice has been called ""a thing of wonder"", makes her Proms debut with Norwegian soprano Mari Eriksmoen and the Hallé orchestra.

8 August: 100 Years of the Shipping Forecast. The subtle magic of the Shipping Forecast is celebrated in a special concert, in Belfast's Ulster Hall, featuring Radio 4's continuity announcers and a new work by poet laureate Simon Armitage.

9 August: The Planets and Star Wars.The National Youth Orchestra play two of the world's most recognisable pieces of orchestral music, with an intergalactic theme.

10 August: Edward Gardner Conducts the LPO.Taking a journey through icy waters and cascading waterfalls, the London Philharmonic present a quartet of pieces, including Debussy's La Mer and Sibelius's Oceanides - with an aquatic theme. Electrifying mezzo-soprano Aigul Akhmetshina joins in, for her Proms debut.

14 August: Joe Hisaishi and Steve Reich.Legendary Studio Ghibli composer Joe Hisaishi makes his Proms debut conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in two large-scale works exploring themes of destruction and loss - including his piece The End of the World, reflecting the ""anxiety and chaos"" after the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York.

23 August: Mäkelä conducts Mahler's Fifth. Finnish conductor Klaus Mäkelä isn't yet 30, but his electrifying performances have already made headlines around the world. He comes to the Proms with the Dutch Concertgebouw Orchestra, to play Mahler's leonine fifth symphony.

7 September: Angelique Kidjo - African Symphony. ""I want to show the world the richness and beauty of African culture,"" says the Beninese-French music icon Angelique Kidjo of her return to the Proms. Part of Bradford's City of Culture programme, her concert will highlight iconic tracks from legends including Miriam Makeba, Fela Kuti and Youssou N'Dour.

The season concludes with the traditional ""Last Night"" on 13 September, conducted by Elim Chan.

Soprano Louise Alder and trumpeter Alison Balsom will make star turns, alongside the traditional medley of sea shanties, Pomp and Circumstance and Auld Lang Syne.

The concert will also include Donat's favourite ""Easter egg"" for her first year in charge.

""There's a piece of music that I'd wanted to get into the Proms for some time,"" she says, referring to Arthur Benjamin's Storm Cloud Contata.

The music was originally written for Alfred Hitchcock's spy thriller The Man Who Knew Too Much in 1934; and re-arranged by Bernard Herrmann for Hitchcock's Hollywood remake in 1956.

""The final scene takes place in the Albert Hall,"" explains Donat, ""and while Jimmy Stewart's chasing this assassin around the building, Bernard Herrmann is conducting the orchestra on stage - and that's the piece we're including in the Last Night of the Proms.

""It's one of those little winks to the audience that I like to include during the season.""

For those who cannot attend, all of the concerts will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and BBC Sounds, and 25 of the nights will be televised.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m9gllw4dzo
Magician who pretended to be a man given Magic Circle membership,"Sophie Lloyd disguised herself as a man to join the Magic Circle in 1991, when female magicians were not allowed membership.",Culture,"Women, Magicians, Magic",Grace Dean,2025-04-23T23:09:29.936Z,2025-04-24T10:32:35.597Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c726/live/e834ee10-2054-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c726/live/e834ee10-2054-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy79nq4yz4o,"A magician who tricked her way into the Magic Circle is finally being granted membership - 34 years after she was kicked out.

Sophie Lloyd says she disguised herself as a man to fool examiners into letting her join the elite society in 1991, at a time female magicians were not allowed to be members.

When the Circle announced it was permitting women to join later that year, Ms Lloyd revealed her deception, prompting the society to expel her at the very same meeting it admitted its first female magicians.

Following a public search to find her, the Circle has now apologised to Ms Lloyd and is presenting her with a membership certificate on Thursday evening.

""I'm beyond thrilled,"" Ms Lloyd toldRadio 4's Today programmeon Thursday.

In the late 1980s, Ms Lloyd was studying at a school of mime in London where she befriended magician Jenny Winstanley.

""Jenny was increasingly frustrated that women, including herself, could not join the Magic Circle,"" Ms Lloyd said. ""So she came up with an idea to infiltrate the society by having me dress as a man. She couldn't do it herself as she was too recognisable.""

It was a colossal undertaking. Ms Lloyd had worked as Miss Winstanley's assistant at gigs but hadn't performed magic on her own, so had to learn.

She invented a new identity - Raymond Lloyd - and spent about two years studying the character. She disguised herself with a wig, body suit and ""croaky"" voice. She wore gloves to hide her feminine hands.

There was nothing she could do about her height - 5ft 2in (1.57m) - so instead she styled Raymond as a ""young-looking, 18-year-old,"" with some facial ""fluff"", she told Canadian broadcasterCBCin 1991.

Ms Lloyd told the Today programme that her character was ""totally believed."" She had no problems wearing the body suit, but the gloves made it ""very hard"" to do sleight of hand tricks, she said.

By March 1991, Ms Lloyd was ready to have her skills put to the test. Rather than being scrutinised at the Magic Circle's headquarters - which Ms Lloyd and Miss Winstanley deemed too risky - Ms Lloyd opted to invite the society's examiners to a 20-minute performance at a working men's club in front of 200 spectators. To cover up her voice, Ms Lloyd said Raymond had laryngitis.

Ms Lloyd even stayed for a drink with one of the examiners after the show.

A week later, Ms Lloyd was told she had been granted membership to the Circle.

For months, Raymond Lloyd performed magic and even socialised with other Magic Circle members.

When Ms Lloyd and Miss Winstanley later heard the society was going to begin accepting female magicians as members, they decided to come clean about their deception and Miss Winstanley told the society about it over the phone.

But the Magic Circle did not take kindly to the news. The duo got a letter saying that Raymond had been expelled, and in October 1991, at the first meeting accepting women into the society, Ms Lloyd was kicked out.

""We couldn't get our heads round it,"" Ms Lloyd said.

Ms Lloyd spent about 10 years performing across the country as a magician, including performing anti-bullying shows, before she moved to Spain, where she took early retirement and has been involved in animal rescue work. Miss Winstanley went on to run a pottery firm in Norfolk, before she died in a car crash in 2004.

The Magic Circle started a search for Ms Lloyd last year.

""I felt it important that the Magic Circle should be able to recognise Sophie as the role model for women magicians, as well as show that we are now a completely open society,"" said Laura London, the society's first female chair.

Ms Lloyd only found out about the search for her when her sister sent her a link to an interview. Initially reluctant to join the society because of the amount of time that had passed, she eventually decided to do it to honour Miss Winstanley's legacy.

Today, the Magic Circle is still heavily male-dominated. The society has around 1,700 members, of which 5% are women.

Ms Lloyd will receive her new membership certificate at an event at the Circle's London headquarters on Thursday evening, which will feature performances by five magicians and be attended by both members of the society and the general public. The society says Miss Winstanley will also be recognised at the event.

""This is for Jenny, really,"" Ms Lloyd said. ""I just think Jenny would have loved it.""

Wednesday season two: Netflix series gets launch date and first glimpse of Joanna Lumley,Joanna Lumley and Steve Buscemi are seen in a new trailer for the hit show's second season.,Culture,"Television, Netflix",Steven McIntosh,2025-04-23T16:29:52.242Z,2025-04-23T16:29:52.242Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/141f/live/443c0ae0-2055-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/141f/live/443c0ae0-2055-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czrv01zpmvro,"The first trailer for the second season of Wednesday - the most watched show in Netflix's history - has given fans the first glimpses of Joanna Lumley and Steve Buscemi in their new roles, alongside a host of returning favourites.

The streamer has announced it will split the new season in half - releasing the first episodes on 6 August and the second batch on 3 September.

This series follows Wednesday Addams, played by Jenna Ortega, as she returns to Nevermore Academy, now under the leadership of new principal Barry Dort (Buscemi).

Also joining the school this term is her little brother Pugsley (Isaac Ordonez), a character described by executive producer Tim Burton as an ""outcast among outcasts"".

Wednesday's parents will also have an increased presence on campus this season - ""a rare new form of torture for the fiercely independent amateur sleuth"", Netflix said.

The first full-length trailer,which was released, appropriately, on Wednesday,opened with the show's lead character going through airport security.

As the metal detector beeps, she has to unload a knuckle duster, cattle prod, several knives and Thing - a disembodied hand - from her bag, before a security guard challenges her about the tube of sun cream she is also carrying.

""Wednesday Addams is one of the coolest characters of all time,""Ortega saidas the trailer launched.

""So to have gotten the opportunity to play her once was incredible, and then to be able to slip into the costume and tone again, it's so much fun.

""She runs circles around everyone that she has a conversation with, so to play someone who's so much more intelligent than you will ever be, it's quite funny and strange and enjoyable.""

Veteran British actress Lumley has joined the cast as Hester Frump, Wednesday's grandmother and closest ally.

""The first day on set when Joanna walked on, she just was Hester and she nailed every single line, and it's just so delicious,"" said show creator Miles Millar. ""She's perfect and hilarious.""

Lumley described the Nevermore atmosphere as ""intoxicating"", adding: ""It's wonderful. I get to wear many, many huge wigs, one on top of the other - and lots of quite constraining clothes, so I love it.""

Meanwhile, Buscemi described Principal Dort as ""a bit of a mysterious figure"", adding: ""Something about him is not right, but he loves the school and he has real outcast pride.""

The first series of Wednesday was Netflix's biggest hit to date, and cemented Ortega as a major screen star. She has since appeared in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, Death of a Unicorn and Scream XI.

In the trailer, Wednesday's mother Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) notes it's the first time her daughter has returned to school willingly.

For her part, Wednesday describes returning to school as ""like returning to the scene of the crime"", noting that she ""already knows where the bodies are buried"".

Later, the young Addams daughter is seen attending a macarbre tea party for a group of dolls.

""Wherever there's murder and mayhem,"" Wednesday reflects, ""you will always find an Addams.""

The trailer's reference to ""mayhem"" could hint at a previously reportedcameo appearance from Lady Gaga,who recently released an album of that name.

Netflix will be hoping the series replicates the success of the first. Its decision to split the new season in half is likely due to efforts to retain subscribers, refresh its platform and increase the hype around the show.

Young has three nominations including best song musically and lyrically for her breakthrough hit Messy, which spent a month at number one in the UK earlier this year.

She is also shortlisted in the best album category, where she will go up against Charli XCX's Brat, which became a cultural phenomenon last summer.

The Ivor Novello Awards are coveted in the UK music industry because they specifically celebrate songwriting.

Charli, rapper Ghetts and singer Raye all have two nominations each, as has Young's co-writer Conor Dickinson.

Other contenders include Fontaines DC, Harry Styles, Laura Marling, Bashy and Pa Salieu.

Former Little Mix star Jade is nominated for best contemporary song for her first solo single Angel of My Dreams.

And 40 years after its release, Wham!'s Last Christmas is nominated for the prize for most performed work, which is based on airplay.

The winners will be announced at a ceremony in London on 22 May.

Benson Boone tells haters to 'at least have a good reason',"The chart-topping US singer had the most popular song of last year, but has faced a backlash.",Culture,Music,Ian Youngs,2025-04-23T12:21:37.756Z,2025-04-23T12:21:37.756Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d0d6/live/dda622d0-203a-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d0d6/live/dda622d0-203a-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62x0wlw8nno,"Benson Boone scored the world's most popular song of last year with Beautiful Things - but that success has come with a backlash.

The US singer has now sent a message to his haters, asking them to make their criticism more constructive.

""If you hate me or my music at least have a good reason for it,"" the 22-year-old wrote ina message on TikTok.

""I just read a comment that said 'idek [I dont even know] why I hate Benson Boone but it feels right.' Like WHAT!? how am I supposed to improve after reading that?""

The star, who is also known for his love of sparkly jumpsuits and doing athletic on-stage backflips, added: ""At least say something valid like 'he low key just flips everywhere can he doing anything else?'

""Or even 'I just don't like his songs even though I'm basing my opinion off the only one that I've heard over and over' (super valid).""

Boone captioned the video containing his message: ""I'm literally giving you ideas.""

Boone's breakout hit has been near-inescapable on radio and social media, and the impassioned folk-pop anthem is still in both the US and UK top 10s more than a year after its release.

It was the most popular single of 2024 across digital platforms, with more than two billion streams, according to global music trade body the IFPI, beating hits by Sabrina Carpenter, Teddy Swims and Billie Eilish.

Boone was nominated for a Grammy and two Brit Awards, and made headlines at the first weekend of the recent Coachella festival when he brought out Queen guitarist Brian Mayto perform Bohemian Rhapsody.

But with such ubiquity comes criticism.



Pitchfork's savage reviewof his first Coachella set pulled no punches and summed up the sentiment of those who can't stand him.

""Benson Boone is horrible, just godawful, the kind of act that makes you wonder if this whole medium has been worth it,"" the site's critic Paul A Thompson wrote.

""His main stage set, at 7pm on Friday - a preposterous slot for him - was nine absolutely insipid originals that seem designed to soundtrack tearful front-facing confession videos followed by a galling (and inexplicably Brian May-assisted) cover of Bohemian Rhapsody.

""I didn't love it.""

Nora Princiotti, co-host of the We're Obsessed podcast,then waded in.

""I'm also a Benson Boone hater,"" she said. ""So... reading these [Pitchfork] paragraphs and seeing them tweeted out cleared my skin and corrected my posture, because I don't care that that man can do a flip, I hate that song that's all over TikTok, Beautiful Things.

""I hated having to talk about it in conjunction with the Grammys. It didn't deserve anything and I never want to think about him again.""

But Boone isn't going away - he is playing a string of other North American festivals this summer, and is releasing his second album, American Heart, in June.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62x0wlw8nno
Turner Prize nominates neurodiverse and refugee artists,The four artists in the running for this year's prestigious art award are revealed.,Culture,"Turner Prize, Art, Tate art galleries",Paul Glynn,2025-04-23T10:56:46.067Z,2025-04-23T10:56:46.067Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/25bc/live/5896c400-2030-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/25bc/live/5896c400-2030-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c705knpw4r8o,"A learning disabled artist, a former Iraqi refugee and one of the youngest ever nominees are among the artists shortlisted for this year's Turner Prize.

Nnena Kalu, Mohammed Sami, Zadie Xa and Rene Matić - who at 27 is the second youngest artist to be nominated after Damien Hirst - are all in the running for the prestigious annual art prize, the Tate announced on Wednesday.

An exhibition of their work will be held at the Cartwright Hall Art Gallery from September as part of Bradford's UK City of Culture celebrations.

The winner, who will be awarded £25,000, will then be announced on 9 December at a ceremony in the West Yorkshire city.

Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain and chair of the Turner Prize jury, said the shortlist ""reflects the breadth of artistic practice today, from painting and sculpture to photography and installation"".

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the artists, who are each guaranteed to receive £10,000, offer ""extraordinary world-views that are very personal"".

Take a closer look at all four shortlisted artists and their work:

Glasgow-bornNnena Kalu(above), who has limited verbal communication, has been a resident artist with Action Space, which supports artists with learning disabilities, for more than 25 years.

She creates large-scale swirling abstract drawings and sculpures made from colourful streams of repurposed fabrics and materials such as reels of VHS tape.

The jury praised her ""unique command of material, colour and gesture and her highly attuned responses to architectural space"".

Photographer, writer and poetRene Matić, from Peterborough, is nominated for their solo exhibition, As Opposed To The Truth, at CCA Berlin, which touches on the rise of right-wing populism and identities.

Matić captures ""fleeting moments of joy in daily life, and expressions of tenderness within a wider political context"", according to Tate, using intimate photos of family and friends placed in an installation which also includes objects like the artist's collection of black baby dolls salvaged from second-hand shops.

The work looks at themes including ""the constructed self through the lens of rudeness"" and rudeboy culture, a Jamaican subculture.

The jury said they were ""struck by the artist's ability to express concerns around belonging and identity"".

Mohammed Samihails from Baghdad and his work draws on his life and experiences during the Iraq war and as a refugee in Sweden.

The artist is recognised for solo exhibition After the Storm at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, and the jury were impressed by his ""powerful representation"" of war and exile.

His large-scale paintings explore memory and loss, layering patterns and colours to create ""haunting, dreamlike scenes"".

Zadie Xacomes from Vancouver, Canada, and her work is inspired by her Korean heritage and the importance of shamanic beliefs.

Interweaving paintings, murals, traditional patchwork textiles and 650 brass bells that make harmonised sounds inspired by Korean shamanic ritual bells, Xa's art focuses on the sea as ""a spiritual realm to explore traditions and folklore, speaking to a multitude of cultures"".

The jury felt the ""vibrant installation"" was a ""sophisticated development"" of her work.

Established in 1984, the prize is named after radical painter JMW Turner -who would have turned 250 on Wednesday- and is awarded each year to a British-based  artist for an ""outstanding exhibition or other presentation of their work"".

Shanaz Gulzar, creative director Bradford UK City of Culture 2025, said it was ""a huge honour and privilege"" to bring the prize tothe city that gave the world David Hockney.

""Bradford has produced some amazing artists, literary artists, visual artists, contemporary artists,"" she told Radio 4.

""And to have these four artists in Bradford, I think really speaks to how we're delivering our year so far, and it speaks to our audiences.""

Last year's prize was won by Jasleen Kaur, who used a vintage Ford Escort, worship bells and Irn-Bru to celebrate the Scottish Sikh community.

Other ther previous winners have included Sir Anish Kapoor (1991), Damien Hirst (1995) and Sir Steve McQueen (1999).",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c705knpw4r8o
Kneecap say statement at Coachella 'not aggressive' after criticism,Kneecap ended their performance at the California music festival with pro-Palestinian messages.,Northern Ireland,"Belfast, Israel-Gaza war, Northern Ireland, Hip-hop, Music",Claire Quinn,2025-04-23T13:21:06.927Z,2025-04-23T18:52:03.841Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a16f/live/d4362450-203c-11f0-99e1-773f439bd3c0.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a16f/live/d4362450-203c-11f0-99e1-773f439bd3c0.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dr6xvk5x3o,"The west Belfast rap group Kneecap have hit back at acall for their US visas to be revokedafter their performance at Coachella where they ended their set with pro-Palestinian messages.

Writing on social media, TV personality and music manager Sharon Osbourne said the hip-hop trio ""took their performance to a different level by incorporating aggressive political statements"".

When asked by BBC News NI for a response, the band replied: ""Statements aren't aggressive, murdering 20,000 children is though.""

The festival's organisers have also been approached for comment.

Kneecap have been vocal supporters of the Palestinian people, often raising the conflict in their live performances.

Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages.

Israel launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed 51,240 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to figures released by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

The number of children who have been killed in Gaza is disputed. International journalists including the BBC are blocked by Israel from entering Gaza independently so are unable to independently verify figures.

Speaking to Irish broadcaster RTÉ , Kneecap's manager said: ""If somebody is hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by, but it's really important to speak truth.""

Daniel Lambert added: ""Thankfully the lads are not afraid to do that.""

He also said the band had received death threats following their performance at Coachella and described the threats as ""too severe to get into"".

In a statement to BBC News NI, the US State Department said when considering revocations, they look at information that ""may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted"".

The band are set to play a number of shows in the US and Canada in coming months.

On Tuesday, Osbourne claimed on social media the band's actions included ""projections of anti-Israel messages and hate speech"".

""This band openly support terrorist organizations,"" she added.

Ms Osbourne was also critical of the organisers of the festival, Goldenvoice, a subsidiary of Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG).

""Reports indicate that Goldenvoice was unaware of Kneecap's political intentions when they were booked,"" Osbourne said.

""However, after witnessing their performance during the first weekend, allowing them to perform again the following weekend suggests support of their rhetoric and a lack of due diligence,"" she continued.

""This behaviour raises concerns about the appropriateness of their participation in such a festival and further shows they are booked to play in the USA,"" Osbourne said.

""I know for a fact that certain people in the industry had written to Goldenvoice, airing their concerns around the booking of Kneecap,"" she said.

Osbourne is the wife of Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne, and a former judge of TV talent shows The X-Factor and America's Got Talent.

She also managed her husband's solo career.

Osbourne finished her post by saying: ""As someone of both Irish Catholic on my mother's side and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage on her father's side and extensive experience in the music industry, I understand the complexities involved.

""I urge you to join me in advocating for the revocation of Kneecap's work visa.""

The festival organisers have been approached for comment.

At the end of their set at the second weekend of Coachella, which was not streamed on the festival's official YouTube page, Kneecap projected three screens of text.

The first message said: ""Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people,"" followed by: ""It is being enabled by the US government who arm and fund Israel despite their war crimes,"" and a final screen added: ""[Expletive] Israel. Free Palestine.""

During the performance, band member Mo Chara said: ""The Irish not so long ago were persecuted at the hands of the Brits, but we were never bombed from the... skies with nowhere to go.

""The Palestinians have nowhere to go.""

The band also led the audience in chants of: ""Free, free Palestine"".

On 11 April, during Kneecap's first Coachella performance, the group faced criticism after leading an anti-Margaret Thatcher chant - which was subsequently omitted from the festival's livestream - along with calls for a united Ireland.

A US State Department spokesperson said: ""Due to privacy and other considerations, and visa confidentiality, we generally will not comment on department actions with respect to specific cases.""

They said the Trump administration ""is focused on protecting our nation and our citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process"".

""When considering revocations, the department looks at information that arises after the visa was issued that may indicate a potential visa ineligibility under US immigration laws, pose a threat to public safety, or other situations where revocation is warranted,"" they added.

""This can include everything from arrests, criminal convictions, and engaging in conduct that is inconsistent with the visa classification, to an overstay.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dr6xvk5x3o
Letter reveals William Shakespeare did not abandon his wife,New analysis of a letter suggests that the couple's relationship was closer than previously thought.,England,"Stratford-upon-Avon, William Shakespeare, London, University of Bristol, Bristol",James Diamond,2025-04-23T11:36:20.587Z,2025-04-23T11:36:20.587Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7514/live/103cfe20-205f-11f0-bfaa-ab0539d45dd3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7514/live/103cfe20-205f-11f0-bfaa-ab0539d45dd3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygregz439o,"The relationship between William Shakespeare and his wife Anne Hathaway may have been happier than previously thought, according to new research.

For more than 200 years it has been believed that Shakespeare left his wife in Stratford-upon-Avon when he travelled to London and that a decision to leave her almost nothing in his will meant he probably felt bitterness towards her.

However, examination of a fragment of a letter, which is addressed to ""good Mrs Shakespeare"", appears to show they did live together in central London between 1600-1610.

The research was carried out by Prof Matthew Steggle from the University of Bristol's Department of English.

In the letter, which was preserved by accident in the binding of a book in Hereford, it is alleged that Shakespeare is withholding money from an orphan boy named John Butts, with the letter asking Mrs Shakespeare for money instead.

Prof Steggle said: ""First discovered in 1978, the letter's been known for a while, but no-one could identify the names or places involved or see any reason to think that the Mr Shakespeare in the letter was necessarily William rather than anyone else of the same name in the general period.

""So, it's a story about the Shakespeares' marriage, really, as well as about Shakespeare's London contacts.

""And if the writing on the back of the letter is a reply, then it's also a story about the first ever bit of writing which can be attributed to Anne Hathaway.""

The letter refers to the boy being a fatherless apprentice and through his research Prof Steggle says there was only one person in London called John Butts who fits that criterion.

The letter also refers to a Trinity Lane and of the four married couples called Shakspaire (spelling of the time) known to be in London in that period, only William and Anne are likely to have lived in that area.

""It at least doubles the number of letters known to be addressed to or sent from Shakespeare and his family,"" Prof Steggle said.

""Currently, there's only one known. It also shows a side of Shakespeare's London life that's not been known before, giving him a new address in Trinity Lane and a whole new sphere of activity for him.""

Prof Steggle said it ""opens the door"" to the idea Shakespeare's wife did indeed spend ""significant"" time with her husband in London.

""It's not a complete slam dunk,"" he told the BBC.

""It's a possibility that seems difficult to avoid, rather than a certainty.""



Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, author Maggie O'Farrell, whose book Hamnet is a fictionalised account of the marriage between Shakespeare and his wife as they deal with the loss of their son, called the discovery ""thrilling"" and ""wonderful"".

""There have been very respected scholars who've said that she was ugly, that Shakespeare hated her, that she trapped him into marriage, that she was illiterate, that she was stupid,"" Ms O'Farrell said.

""There is absolutely not one shred of evidence for any of that and it's always baffled me as to why she attracts all this vilification and all this misogyny.

""And it's so wonderful to find this tiny fragment of a letter which was discovered in the binding of a book that was published in 1608, that proves of course that they did love each other and probably lived together for some time in London.""

Harvey Weinstein rape retrial: Opening statements begin in New York,"Weinstein, who has pleaded not guilty to sex crimes, returns to court after a conviction was overturned.

""The defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,"" Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey told jurors on Wednesday.

In his third trial in five years, Weinstein is accused of sexually abusing a former television production assistant, an aspiring actress and a model.

The former film mogul has pleaded not guilty, and in court his lawyer sought to cast doubt on the women's claims and credibility.

Attorney Arthur Aidala told the jury the prosecution case would ""fall flat on its face"" after they heard all the evidence.

""They're going to ask you to make sense of things that just don't make sense,"" he said.

A court of appeals overturned Weinstein's previous conviction for sex crimes in New York last April, before he was indicted on new sexual assault charges in the state in September.

Last week, 12 jurors - seven women and five men - were chosen to weigh Weinstein's fate.

On Wednesday, Ms Lucey spent an hour delivering an opening statement, telling jurors that three women had fallen victim to the abuse of a ""Hollywood gatekeeper"" who held ""unfettered power for over 30 years in that industry"".

The retrial in New York is centred on two women who brought allegations against Weinstein for his 2020 trial, actress Jessica Mann and former TV production assistant Miriam Haley. This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of assaulting her when she was 16.

On Wednesday, Ms Lucey recounted the three women's stories of assault and harassment, sparing few details. The alleged encounters often involved Weinstein bringing women to his room under the guise of a business meeting, before he allegedly forced himself onto them.

Victims ""kept their shame and their pain to themselves"" for years because of Weistein's role as a man who ""defined the field"" of acting and film, Ms Lucey said.

During his hour of opening statements that followed, Weinstein's attorney took a combative approach, accusing the women of having ""mutually beneficial"" sexual relationships with Weinstein and being motivated by money.

""These women are addicted to that fame,"" Mr Aidala said. ""They want to be heroes.""

Mr Aidala argued that Weinstein could not have assaulted the women because they kept in contact with him and sent him friendly messages after the encounters.

Last April, a court of appeals said Weinstein, now 73, did not receive a fair trial in New York in 2020 because the judge overseeing his case allowed testimony from women who made allegations against him for conduct he was never charged over.

Weinstein had been serving a 23-year sentence in a New York prison after being convicted.

He was also found guilty of rape in a separate trial in California in 2022 and was sentenced to 16 years in that case.

Weinstein has several medical conditions, including cancer and diabetes. In September, he was taken to hospital for heart surgery and has been held in a secure hospital unit.

A judge has approved a request from Weinstein's lawyers to let him stay at the Bellevue hospital in Manhattan when he is not in court.

His lawyers had complained that he was receiving poor medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at the infamous Rikers Island prison facility - which officials have long said they plan to close - though the move has been delayed.

In total, Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct, assault and rape by more than 100 women.

He is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison, as he has yet to begin serving his 16-year California sentence.

The decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.

Speaking to jurors on Wednesday, Ms Lucey said the movement had allowed the three women to come forward in the criminal case against Weinstein after they ""suddenly realized they were not alone"".

Before the allegations against him emerged, Weinstein and his brother Bob were among Hollywood's ultimate power players.

Weinstein co-founded Miramax film studio, whose hits included Shakespeare in Love, which won best picture at the Academy Awards, and Pulp Fiction.

His films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations and 81 wins.

The presenter and the BBC jointly announced in November that he would be stepping down from the flagship football programme, although he will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.

Asked by the BBC's Amol Rajan why he would choose to leave given his successful tenure, Lineker said: ""Well, perhaps they want me to leave. There was the sense of that.""

The BBC didn't comment on that suggestion, but at the time Lineker's exit was announced, the corporation's director of sport described him as a ""world-class presenter"".

However, the BBC noted in the same statement that Match of the Day ""continually evolves for changing viewing habits"".

A new trio of presenters - Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan -was announced in January.

Reflecting on his departure from Match of the Day, Lineker told Rajan: ""It's time. I've done it for a long time, it's been brilliant.""

However, asked why he'd want to leave when the ratings were still high and it was a job Lineker still enjoyed, the former footballer said he ""had the sense"" the BBC had wanted him to step down.

""I always wanted one more contract, and I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to do three years [more],"" Lineker explained.

But, he continued, the matter of how long to sign for was complicated by the cycle of broadcasting rights for matches.

""In the end, I think there was a feeling that, because it was a new rights period, it was a chance to change the programme,"" he said.

""I think it was their preference that I didn't do Match of the Day for one more year, so they could bring in new people. So it's slightly unusual that I would do the FA Cup and the World Cup, but to be honest, it's a scenario that suits me perfectly.""

Lineker added that he was pleased his football podcasts had been picked up by BBC Sounds as part of a deal with the corporation.

Lineker was also asked about comments he posted on social media in March 2023, criticising the then-government's immigration policy.

The remarks led to his suspension from the BBC, prompting other sports presenters to down tools in solidarity, something Lineker said he felt ""moved"" by.

Reflecting on his tweets, Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the ""damage"" it did to the BBC.

""I don't regret saying them publicly, because I was right - what I said, it was accurate - so not at all in that sense.

""Would I, in hindsight, do it again? No I wouldn't, because of all the nonsense that came with it... It was a ridiculous overreaction that was just a reply to someone that was being very rude. And I wasn't particularly rude back.""

He continued: ""But I wouldn't do it again because of all the kerfuffle that followed, and I love the BBC, and I didn't like the damage that it did to the BBC... But do I regret it and do I think it was the wrong thing to do? No.""

The row erupted when Lineker called a government asylum policy ""immeasurably cruel"", and said a video promoting it used language that was ""not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s"".

The home secretary at the time, Suella Braverman, who appeared in the video, called his criticism ""offensive"" and ""lazy"", while Downing Street said it was ""not acceptable"".

Lineker's post reignited the debate about the BBC's impartiality guidance on social media and how it applied to presenters.

While staff working in news and current affairs are expected to remain impartial on social platforms, there had been questions over how much the rules extended to BBC personalities in other areas such as entertainment and sport.

Lineker argued that the previous set of rules ""were for people in news and current affairs"".

""They have subsequently changed,"" he acknowledged. ""But that left people like me, who has always given his honest opinions about things, then they suddenly changed them and you have to go, 'Oh, I've got to be impartial now'. It doesn't make any sense.""

He added: ""I've always been strong on humanitarian issues and always will be, and that's me.""

Lineker said that, following his tweets, ""the goalposts were massively moved because it was never an issue until, suddenly, this point"".

The BBCupdated its social media guidance in 2023following a review that was commissioned in the wake of the fallout over Lineker's tweets.

The corporation said presenters of flagship programmes, such as Match of the Day, ""carry a particular responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC"".

Asked if he understood that his comments gave ammunition to the BBC's critics, Lineker said: ""Yes of course, I understand that, but does it make it wrong what I did? I don't think so. Would I do it if I knew what would've happened and transpired? Of course I wouldn't.""

Lineker hit the headlines again recently when he, along with 500 other high-profile figures,signed an open later urging the BBCto reinstate a documentary about Gaza to iPlayer.

The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.

Lineker told Rajan he would ""100%"" support the documentary being made available again, arguing: ""I think you let people make their own minds up. We're adults. We're allowed to see things like that. It's incredibly moving.""

He added that, although the 13-year-old was narrating the programme, the script had ""not been written by [the child], it's been written by the people who produced the show"".

""I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot,"" he said.

After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the programme while it carried out further due diligence. The matter is currently still being investigated by the corporation.

The BBC said it had identified serious flawsin the making of the documentary.The BBC board saidthe mistakes were ""significant and damaging"".

In the wide-ranging interview, which will be broadcast on Tuesday, Lineker also discussed his footballing career, his son's leukemia battle as a baby, and his views on gambling sponsorship in sports.

Lineker said the football industry should rethink its responsibility when it comes to taking money from gambling firms.

""I know people [for whom] it becomes an addiction, it can completely destroy their lives,"" he said.

""There's talk about taking [logos] off the shirts, but you see it on the boards around the ground everywhere.

""I think football needs a long, hard look at itself about that, I really do.""

On top of his presenting roles, Lineker is also the co-founder of Goalhanger Podcasts, which make the successful The Rest is History series and its spin-offs about Politics, Football, Entertainment and Money.

The 64-year-old indicated to Rajan his next career move ""won't be more telly"", adding: ""I think I'll step back from that now.

""I think I'll probably focus more on the podcast world, because it's such a fun business and it's just been so incredible.""

Tina Knowles: I worry about Beyoncé and Jay-Z's fame impacting their kids,Beyoncé’s mum says she’s concerned about her grandchildren reading ‘lies’ put out about them.,Culture,"Culture, JAY-Z, Beyoncé, Music",Noor Nanji,2025-04-22T13:00:11.961Z,2025-04-22T13:00:11.961Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5519/live/b33d6f10-1f83-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5519/live/b33d6f10-1f83-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0wr0x938po,"Beyoncé and Jay-Z are one of the world's most famous power couples.

And they now have an equally famous family, with daughter Blue Ivy, 13, and seven-year-old twins, Rumi and Sir.

But Beyoncé's mother, businesswoman and fashion designer Tina Knowles, tells me she ""worries about the fame"" impacting her grandchildren.

""If I had my first choice, they would not have to deal with the things that they have to deal with as kids,"" she says.

Knowles, 71, says for now, the children are not too exposed to it.

""But one day they'll read the ignorance that people put out there about them, the lies and all of that,"" she says. ""And I do worry about that.""

Despite those pressures, she says Beyoncé and Jay-Z - who are notoriously private about their home life - are doing an ""amazing"" job as parents.

""The truth is they spend abnormal amount of time with their children and they have great relationships with their kids,"" she says.

""And they're just great parents. I don't think you could ask for better parents.""

Knowles is speaking to BBC News ahead of the publication of her new memoir, Matriarch.

It covers her childhood in Texas, her daughters' rise to fame and her later years, as a grandmother.

Knowles now has four grandchildren, including Julez Smith, the son of her younger daughter, singer-songwriter Solange. She also considers herself a grandmother to former Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland's children.

She says that she sees all her grandchildren regularly, describing them as ""one of the biggest joys in my life"".

""[Blue Ivy and I] have a very close bond,"" she says of her eldest granddaughter.

""I'm so happy that she feels like she can talk to me,"" she says, adding that Blue Ivy is always giving her advice about taking care of herself.

""She's my beauty guru. She's my manager,"" she says.

I'm intrigued by this, and ask why she calls the 13-year-old her manager.

""Well, I don't call her my manager. Everybody else calls her my manager, because she's bossy. She's a little Capricorn like me. So we have that bond.""

Knowles grew up in 50s and 60s Galveston, the youngest of seven.

In her book, she talks about the harassment her family faced, including from the police.

""There was a lot of racial tension,"" she tells me. ""And I think some things have changed, but I still think that black people are more susceptible to police brutality [and] being stopped.""

She met her now ex-husband, Mathew Knowles, in Houston and the pair went on to have two daughters, Beyoncé in 1981 and Solange five years later.

Beyoncé, she writes, was ""not an easy baby"". Nursery rhymes did not cut it (""she cried louder"" to drown out Mary Had A Little Lamb), but jazz music would soothe her.

As a child, Solange was a “social butterfly” but Beyoncé was shy. ""She walked into every classroom trying to be invisible,"" Knowles writes.

She says at the time, her daughters - and all little black girls - were being ""bombarded"" by messages from mainstream culture that they were ""less than"".

But Beyoncé was always singing, and Solange's talent emerged early on too.

""I knew Beyoncé had a very beautiful voice, but I didn't know how talented she was until she was seven,"" Knowles tells me.

""And Solange probably four, because she just grew up around nothing but music and performances. So she was a lot earlier.""

Knowles is adamant that she didn't push her daughters into the music industry.

""Absolutely not. This was not my first choice for my girls. They just lived and breathed music,"" she says.

""It is their decision. They were born to be entertainers.""

None of them - including Kelly Rowland, who moved in with the family - were very rebellious, she says. All they wanted to do was sing, dance and perform.

""I wanted them to have that experience of teenage life and going out to parties and having fun, but I had to force them to do that,"" she says.

In the 1990s, the girl group Destiny's Child was formed. It originally comprised Beyoncé, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett, but the final line-up was a trio - Beyoncé, Rowland, and Michelle Williams.

The band achieved worldwide fame with mega hits such as Bills, Bills, Bills, Say My Name and Jumpin', Jumpin'.

Knowles, who ran a hair salon Headliners and had learned dressmaking, made costumes for the group, while Mathew Knowles quit his job to manage them.

Their daughters have gone on to forge hugely successful solo careers.

Solange won a Grammy Award for Cranes in the Sky, while Beyoncé has had countless hits including Single Ladies, Crazy in Love, Halo and Irreplaceable.

She finally won best albumat this year's Grammy Awards - correcting what was widely seen as an historic wrong.

The star was recognised for her eighth album, Cowboy Carter, which celebrates and contextualises the black roots of country music.

In an Instagram post ahead of her album launch, Beyoncé said Cowboy Carter was ""born out of an experience that I had years ago where I did not feel welcome"" that prompted her to take ""a deeper dive into the history of country"".

Many interpreted that as a reference to her treatment at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where her performance of Daddy Lessons with The Chicks led to a barrage of criticism - and racism - online.

Knowles says Beyoncé’s childhood, growing up in Texas and spending time in Louisiana, influenced her music.

""She was very influenced by [Zydeco, a music genre from Louisiana], and that culture and cowboy culture,"" she says.

She added it was ""interesting"" to hear some saying Beyoncé is ""not country Western"" and shouldn't be making that kind of music.

""It is in her. It’s in her right to make whatever music she feels like making.""

As her daughters rose to international fame, they have had to deal with media pressure and trolling - including, Knowles writes, the speculation that Beyoncé was faking her pregnancy with Blue Ivy.

There was also an infamous argument between Solange and her brother-in-law Jay-Zin an elevator in 2014, which was leaked by celebrity site TMZ.

Knowles refuses to be drawn on the lift incident.

But when asked how she protects her daughters from comments and trolling online, she says it's actually them who protect her.

“They are very astute at blocking out the bull and the lies. And do they hurt them? Sure, but they don't even focus on that,"" she says.

""While the world is creating lies and mess, my girls are somewhere in the studio or with their kids minding their business and living their best life.""

She refuses to take credit for keeping her daughters grounded.

""I didn't keep them on the straight and narrow. They are just very sensible people with balance in their life,"" she says.

Knowles also opens up in her book about being diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in her left breast, after doctors discovered two tumours.

She is now cancer free.

""My daughters and my faith carried me through,"" she writes.

So what's next for this family of superstars?

Knowles is optimistic, saying ""the sky's the limit"" when it comes to what her daughters might do next.

As for her grandchildren, she says they are being nurtured in ""anything that they want for themselves... but definitely not pushed in the show business"".

At just 13,Blue Ivy has already made stridesin her career. Last year, she voiced the character of Kiara in The Lion King prequel Mufasa: The Lion King, and she also performed alongside her mother on her Renaissance tour.

But Knowles says that's something Blue Ivy had to ""work for"".

""Because her mum was like, no, you got time. You got to make sure that, you know, a lot comes with that.

""And so if anything, they're being nurtured to be the best human beings they can be. That's first priority.""

As for whether we can expect Matriarch to be adapted into a reality series, Knowles is reticent.

""Oh, not a reality series, but you know, I have been talking to people about the movie rights to it and I would love to see a film made,"" she says.

""One of my favourite films is the Jacksons' story. Me and my kids watched it so many times and I just think that it'd be great to see that on film.""

Race Across the World winner Alfie Watts on 'authentic travel' ,"As series five begins, 2024 winner Alfie Watts shares his travel tips, experiences and bucket list.",Culture,"Television, Travel",Paul Glynn,2025-04-19T09:36:06.741Z,2025-04-19T09:36:06.741Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f018/live/c5669e50-1b91-11f0-bfb8-e70272d1ce18.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f018/live/c5669e50-1b91-11f0-bfb8-e70272d1ce18.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxgq1pyypqo,"Last year, Alfie Watts went global, becoming the youngest ever winner of Race Across the World - the BBC show that does exactly what it says on the tin.

Teams of two race to get from one part of the world to another with no air travel, no smartphones, no bank cards and a limited cash budget.

After 50 days spent travelling by land and sea from Japan to Indonesia alongside his St Albans schoolfriend Owen Wood, it all came down to a foot race by a beach off the island of Lombok.

The series four finale saw the pair pip mother and daughter duo Eugenie and Isabel by a mere eight minutes to take the title and£20,000 prize pot.

It also saw Alfie catch the travel bug, sending him on his way to a new career as a travel guru and onlinecontent creator.

As series five of the show gets underway on Wednesday, BBC News speaks to the 21-year-old about his new life on the road, advice for fellow travellers and tips for this year's contestants on how to win the show.

""The whole experience [on the show] kind of opened my eyes to real travel,"" Watts tells us over a video call from Portugal, while taking a break from refereeing a football match.

""I think there are definitely two different types of travel that we're used to in the UK; shallow travel, as I'd call it, where you go on holiday and you see what you want to see and you stay within your comfort zone or hotel.

""And then I'd say there's real authentic travel whereby you see the world as it actually is.

""And I've just learned that I actually much prefer the authenticity of places... rather than the weather.""

Watts's main advice for readers with a similar wanderlust is to consider travelling ""further afield"".

""Flights to Spain in the summer might be £300 return, but you are going to be paying extremely high prices for food, accommodation and things like that,"" he notes.

""Whereas, actually, if you go a little bit further afield, if you try Malaysia, Thailand, even Brazil, for sure the flights might be £600-700 but when you're actually there, you're spending £20-25 a day maximum.""

He adds: ""You're helping local people and you're trying something new.""

Since his big TV win, Watts has been to around 30 countries, including five in one day for a Europe-based online challenge.

Another time he found and boarded the cheapest possible flights he could find online for seven days straight.

And he also returned to Japan to pay a bill he felt he owed for some Kobe beef steaks that were kindly donated to him and Wood for free when they were worried about their budget, as fans of the show will remember. ""That was a really nice moment,"" he says.

Watts likes to travel solo as he enjoys his ""own company"" and doing things on his ""own terms"", while also meeting new people.

He acknowledges that it's not for everyone, and that some people prefer to be away with friends and family, but he wants to encourage would-be travellers to ""throw yourself in"", responsibly.

""I don't do things that would put me in danger because I think I have a responsibility to the people that follow me,"" he says.

He does admit though that he once ended up in a taxi with an armed government official in Venezuela - a country he travelled to against UK goverment guidance.

""That was about as wacky as it got.""

His favourite place he has been on his travels so far is ""without doubt"" Angel Falls in Venezuela, while his favourite country would be a coin flip between Jordan and Malaysia.

One thing he'd still like to tick off his bucket list is visiting the remote island of Tuvalu in the South Pacific Ocean, which sounds like a pitch for a new TV show in itself.

""It's the least visited country in the world,"" he explains.

""Only 1,500 people go there every year. It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.""

As well as becoming far better travelled (and able to offer visa guidance to his followers), the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways; acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK - a mental health charity for young people - and Winston's Wish - a children and young people's grief charity.

One of the most heart-rending moments of series four was when it was revealed that Watts's mum had died of cancer when he was just a child.

Speaking ofhis ambassadorial work, he says: ""I love it and I'm so glad that I get to have the opportunity [to help].

""But internalising it, it can be quite challenging, listening to people's stories.""

Race Across the World resumes on Wednesday, witha new raft of contestantsheading this time from north eastern China to the southernmost tip of India.

They include ex-spouses Gaz and Yin, and current couple Fin and Sioned, as well as sisters Elizabeth and Letitia, brothers Brian and Melvyn and mother and son duo Caroline and Tom.

The rules, as usual, are no smart phones, no bank cards (just a small cash budget) and no air travel.

Watts thinks it's going to be a ""really tough route"" and a ""topsy-turvy"" series.

""China is very easy to get around but very hard to communicate,"" he stresses from personal experience. ""And a lot of China doesn't accept cash anymore.""

His ""number one piece of advice"" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. ""We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else"".

He also suggests hacks like packing ""little travel placards"" with pictures of buses, trains and people on, for ease of communication.

""I think now there's more and more series, people are watching it and starting to think, 'actually, this is where they're going wrong. This is how we can be creative around it'.

""And I think we're probably going to see that this series, that people have been a lot more streetwise with how they've prepared.""

Is he worried about losing his title as the show's youngest winner?

He replies, like a true international diplomat, that he just wants the pair who ""nicely interact"" with the others and ""who genuinely appreciate the opportunity to travel"" to win.

""I think those are always the people that you want to do best, and if that happens to be the two 18-year-olds this time, then I'll be happy to hand my crown over.""

Latey: Looking for Love - how Ethiopia's answer to The Bachelor sparked controversy,Ethiopia's answer to The Bachelor has prompted discussions about dating norms in the conservative country.,Africa,"Television, Africa, Ethiopia",Wedaeli Chibelushi & Nyasha Michelle,2025-04-20T23:04:50.339Z,2025-04-20T23:04:50.339Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1260/live/ddbcd600-1ad2-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1260/live/ddbcd600-1ad2-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70zxzd69r3o,"Boy meets girl. Girl falls for boy. Girl fends off love rivals and boy - finally - declares his affection for her.

If you are a fan of reality TV dating shows, you will have seen several variations of this plot - it is a well-worn storyline that has played out on the likes of Love Island, Love is Blind and The Bachelor.

But in Ethiopia, this romantic scenario has broken convention.

Content creator Bethel Getahun won over insurance agent Messiah Hailemeskel in Latey: Looking for Love - a reality TV show that ignited debates about dating norms in the conservative East African country.

Latey's premise mirrored that of the aforementioned hit US show, The Bachelor (in fact, Latey is Amharic for bachelor/bachelorette).

Ten women had to compete for the affection of Mr Messiah, a 38-year-old Ethiopian-American who grew up and lives in Dallas.

Throughout the series, the women battled it out in boxing matches, basketball contests and even a bizarre task where they had to devise a TV advert for a mattress, à la The Apprentice.

Broadcast on YouTube, Latey is a rare dating programme in a country where courtship is traditionally a private affair.

Winning such a ground-breaking show felt ""surreal"", 25-year-old Ms Bethel told the BBC's Focus on Africa podcast. Weeks on from the finale, which racked up more than 620,000 views, her victory still ""feels like a badge of honour"".

Of course, not everyone feels the same way.

""The concept of a dating show is entirely [a] Western idea,"" says Ethiopian vlogger Semere Kassaye.

""Dating in Ethiopia has always been a private matter, something that is nurtured carefully and only brought to the attention of family or society when it reaches a level of maturity.""

Mr Semere, 41, also feels that the show devalues women, treating them as objects to be acquired.

Several viewers voiced the same opinion - one commenter on YouTube wrote: ""Ladies, you are not an object that the one with money can easily pick you up.""

Another asked: ""Lots of creativity on the production but if it is against the culture, what is the point?""

Ms Bethel agrees that the concept of women openly competing for a man clashes with Ethiopian traditions, but insists that the show is more than its central premise.

""The whole point of the show is to represent different kinds of women,"" she says.

""If you have seen the episodes, you can see every woman in that episode has a lot of different struggles, backgrounds, and all different kinds of stuff that hasn't really been expressed or represented in media in Ethiopia.""

Arguably, Latey succeeds in this respect. The women - who include hotel managers, flight attendants and accountants - swiftly bond, sharing their personal stories with each other and the viewers.

In one of the more heart-breaking scenes, actress Vivian divulges that she fled to Ethiopia from Eritrea, a neighbouring country thatenforces indefinite military conscription for all able-bodied citizens. It has also been widely accused of human rights violations.

Vivian travelled alone to Ethiopia and has not seen her mother in five years.

""I miss her so much,"" she says tearfully.

Elsewhere, Rahel, a model, explains that she dropped out of school to take on multiple jobs and provide for her siblings, while other women have emotional conversations about grief and their reverence for those who raised them.

By baring these women's realities - and their romantic desires - Latey cemented its place as the ""content of its times"", producer Metasebia Yoseph tells the BBC.

Ms Metasebia, co-founder of D!nkTV, Latey's production company, says the show ""rocked the boat"", but is far from an affront to Ethiopian culture.

""Number one - it is not hyper-sexualised,"" she says.

""We leave it on the more innocent, get-to-know-you, stages of dating.""

She says the show also asks its viewers to interrogate the concept of culture, ""sparking dialogue about 'What is our culture? Are we a monolith?'""

Adapting a universal reality TV formula to Ethiopia has delighted many, with one fan commenting: ""I totally love the risk-taking, considering how reserved we are as a society... I have always wanted to see other shows in Ethiopian version. This is a ground-breaking moment.""

A second viewer wrote: ""I never imagined watching The Bachelor in Ethiopia, but you have done an excellent job bringing it to life.""

Off the back of this success, D!nk TV is planning a second series.

This time, Ms Metasebia says, a single woman could be the one picking her match from 10 male hopefuls.

""We're getting a lot of feedback from the audience, people want to see the roles reversed,"" she explains.

As for Ms Bethel and Mr Messiah? Sadly, their love story has come to a halt.

""It is long distance because he's in America right now with his son. So it's really difficult... I don't know where it's going to go, basically,"" she says.

But Ms Bethel is still close to some of her fellow contestants, who she fondly refers to as her ""sorority"".

She is proud that Latey showcased ""the romantic side of Ethiopia"" and believes the show will lead to better representations of women in Ethiopian media.

""It is a new way of showcasing women and how they express themselves,"" she says.

""It is a new way of seeing.""

Where UK country music might go next as pop's Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter explore the genre,"Since Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Lana Del Rey have explored country.",Newsbeat,"Country music, Manchester, Beyoncé, Music",Riyah Collins,2025-04-19T23:47:02.778Z,2025-04-19T23:47:02.778Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b806/live/d44ff390-1528-11f0-bc17-dfa4f8dfee61.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b806/live/d44ff390-1528-11f0-bc17-dfa4f8dfee61.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r88nxv1wyo,"They say the recipe for a good country track is simple - just combine three chords and the truth.

Over the past year though, a growing number of artists have been adding their own sprinkles with pop stars including Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter leaning into the genre.

Chappell's The Giver went straight to number two in the UK charts when it was released in March, with the self-proclaimed Midwest Princess saying she wanted to give country music a new take with ""a little gay yodel"".

Figures from streaming platforms suggest that cooking up a country song has also been a recipe for success, with listening time up by 25% over the past year in the UK.

British artists are hopeful that'll act as a giddy up to the UK scene and help them replicate some of the success of their US country cousins.

""It only benefits me and other country music artists in the UK because more people listening to country music just means they're going to take an interest - hopefully - in what we're doing,"" 20-year-old singer Neeve Zahra tells BBC Newsbeat.

Her love for country music comes from two sources: her grandad and Hannah Montana.

The Disney Channel school-girl-by-day-pop-star-by-night character played by Miley Cyrus ""probably started me off"", she says.

""I can now officially say I was country before country was cool.""

Neeve, from Manchester, is already noticing a spike in people coming to gigs and hopes the hype could build to a point where British country acts can be recognised with a category at the Brit Awards.

""That's definitely the dream.""

Izzie Walsh is currently recording her debut album and tells Newsbeat it's important fans support country artists ""at a grassroots level"" to ensure it can continue to grow in the UK.

""Everyone's been sleeping on it and now it's become this big thing.

""There's a lot of support for the big US artists and it can be hard to compete with that budget, the press.

""There's a big gap between people like me and these massive artists.""

In as far as a trend can ever be attributed to one person, this resurgence in the mainstream is ""100%"" down to Beyoncé, according to country music podcaster Matt Clewes.

Her 2024 album Cowboy Carter ""very much splits opinions with country fans"", Matt tells Newsbeat, but ""it has introduced new country artists to a country audience and gives a different perspective"".

Artists and critics predicted last yearCowboy Carter could ""open the floodgates""for country music fans and Spotify credits ""viral tracks"" from 2024 with the sudden uptick in streams.

But there's actually been a gradual increase in listenership going back much further it says, with streams of the genre in the UK growing by 154% since 2019, the year Lil Nas X released Old Town Road with country singer-songwriter Billy Ray Cyrus.

Apple Music says it's noticed similar trends and both streamers report its rising popularity is particularly striking in the UK, where according to Apple it's growing five times as quickly as in the US.

That's reflected in some of the biggest songs of the past year.

Sabrina Carpenter's country-pop hit Please, Please, Please, which she re-released with Dolly Parton, spent five weeks at number one in the UK and Shaboozey's A Bar Song was a fixture of the top 10 for months.

British country music is even set to be represented on one of the world's biggest stages next month thanks to the UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday.

""Storytelling is so important to us and that is really rooted in country music,"" singer Lauren Byrne tells Newsbeat about why the trio felt drawn to the genre.

""We never wanted to feel like we were trying to replicate or copy, we wanted to always make it feel our own.

""It doesn't all have to be 'yeehaw'.""

Matt says the next step will be to see British country artists headlining bigger festivals as the fan base continues to grow.

And as it does, he says it'll have to embrace the different points of view feeding into it.

Country is often associated with being dominated by male artists, but the musicians driving it into the mainstream are mainly women.

Last week Lana Del Rey joined Beyoncé, Chappell and Sabrina with her country song Henry, come on, but before them it was Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus and Shania Twain making country more popular.

""We're in the year of women in general for music,"" says Neeve. ""I think now it's time for the country women.""

As British country music grows, there are a few differences too with the traditional US scene that will also need embracing.

""We're often seen as, 'Why are they making country music? They don't live the country lifestyle',"" Matt says. ""We don't all live on farms, we don't all drive tractors.

""But country is all about storytelling and everyone wants to write their own story.

""It's evolving all the time so we have to be open to different styles and different perspectives.""

Neeve agrees that authenticity is the key to British country.

""It's about telling our own story,"" she says.

""I can dream about Nashville and maybe write some songs about it but I'm not gonna say I'm gonna pick you up in my truck because I don't have a truck.

""You've got to stay real to yourself. We try to keep it country but in our own way.""

A Chinese official said there had been no trade talks with the US, despite suggestions otherwise from the Trump administration.

The trade war between the world's two largest economies has been escalating, with China sending back Boeing planes it ordered from the US in its latest retaliation over tariffs.

The current rule allows international retailers to send packages to the UK worth less than £135 without incurring import taxes.

Former Dragon's Den star Theo Paphitis, whose retail group includes the Ryman and Robert Dyas, told the BBC the measure was ruining UK High Streets.

Some retailers have argued they are being undercut by overseas rivals, but a body representing small businesses said scrapping the exemption could raise costs for them and price rises for customers.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced on Wednesday that the government planned to review the customs treatment of low-value products entering the UK following complaints from retailers.

The explosion of parcels being shipped under the measure has prompted increased scrutiny in recent years. While all retailers use the exemption, those who sell fast-fashion and cheap goods have seen their sales soar.

It has fuelled the rise of Chinese retailers, such as online giants Shein and Temu, which ship low-value packages to the UK and other countries to reach millions of customers.

Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Paphitis said retailers had been lobbying government ""for a very, very long time"", arguing the rule had had devastating impact ""on our retail landscape and our high streets"".

He joined the bosses of Sainsbury's, Currys and the British Retail Consortium in welcoming the government's consultation on the rule.

UK businesses bringing in larger shipments have to pay taxes, and they also argue that cheaper goods might fail to meet the same environmental and ethical standards that they keep to.

Aside from concerns over unfair competition with domestic retailers, it has also been raised that governments could be missing out on potential tax income.

The so called ""de minimis"" rule has received renewed interest after US president Donald Trump scrapped a similar measure in America amid his escalating trade war with China.

Goods worth less than $800 into the US will soon be subject to charges, where they were previously exempt. The move has already prompted Chinese retailers to raise their prices.

In the UK, there are further concerns that China will dump goods here to avoid the tariffs which Trump has imposed on Chinese goods.

Earlier this month, the boss of Currystold the Financial Timesthat the ""single biggest area where lots of stock is likely to land in the UK... is from the likes of Shein, Temu, Alibaba, TikTok shop and, most of all, Amazon marketplace"".

On Thursday, Alex Baldock told the BBC he was pleased the government was ""reviewing the low-value shipment loophole, and that they're committed to levelling the playing field between British and overseas retailers"".

But the Federation of Small Businesses urged the government to proceed with caution in its de minimis consultation, suggesting that scrapping it might ""ultimately lead to higher prices for consumers"".

""With 16% of goods moved by small firms sitting below the £135 threshold, a decision to scrap it impacts on trading and inflation,"" said Tina McKenzie, chair of the FSB.

""It's right to be concerned about potential future dumping of goods, as escalating tariffs applied by bigger global blocs against each other may mean a surge in goods arriving in markets like our own,"" she added.



Mr Paphitis told the BBC it was ""absolute nonsense"" that the measure kept inflation and prices down, arguing it led to a loss of jobs and tax revenue for the UK, due to businesses being unable to compete with cheaper foreign rivals.

Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, the trade body for retailers, said the review was ""more critical now"" due to a ""rise in the number of potentially non-compliant products entering the UK market"".

The British Independent Retailers Association said small packages having no tax or charges was a key concern. It called on ministers to act to ""deter import surges"" in order to ""protect independent retailers"".

When Sainsbury's announced their latest financial results earlier this month, boss Simon Roberts called on the government to act as soon as possible.

""Everyone should pay their tax... so if there's a loophole here which means that's not happening then that needs to be closed so it's a level playing field for everybody,"" he said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c078j4kylz3o

He did not set out details of the ""zonal pricing"" scheme, which is meant to make the national energy grid more efficient and encourage investment.

But he rejected claims in aDaily Telegraph articlethat it would mean increased energy bills for southern English households.

Some energy companies have backed the idea - but others say it will scare off investment and lead to higher bills.

According to the Telegraph government officials have advised Miliband to back plans for a form of regional pricing used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden.

If implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation.

Under the scheme, power costs would match local supply and demand. In practice it could lead tolower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotlandrather than households in the South.

The scheme is supported by some energy businesses - including Greg Jackson, the boss of Octopus Energy, the UK's largest domestic energy supplier.

Mr Jackson said it could make the overall system more efficient and reduce the amount of network upgrades needed to shift the electricity from where it's generated to where it's consumed.

But Dale Vince, the founder of green energy company Ecotricity and a Labour donor, said on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that zonal pricing was a ""terrible idea"" as ""tens of millions of Britons could end up paying more for their energy than they do now"".

Speaking ahead ofan international energy security summit in London, Miliband said the government were considering options to change energy pricing but insisted ""absolutely no decision has been made"".

""This is an incredibly complex question that we are looking at about how we reform our energy market,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

""There are two options, zonal pricing and reformed national pricing.

""Whatever route we go down my bottom line is bills have got to fall, and they should fall throughout the country.

""We are going to take our time over this very complex and important decision.""



Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the plans ""a form of bribery"", saying cheaper bills would be a payoff for massive infrastructure projects ""ruining"" the local area.

""None of this I think has been fully thought through,"" he argued.

""I think Ed Miliband has a religious fervour for achieving that zero, regardless of the consequences.""

Rachel Reeves signals UK could lower US car tariffs in push for trade deal,"UK negotiators are working ""flat out"" to get a trade deal with the US, Chancellor Rachel Reeves says.",Business,"Rachel Reeves, Trump tariffs, Global trade, UK economy",Faisal Islam & Tom Espiner & Esyllt Carr,2025-04-23T17:01:09.075Z,2025-04-23T17:53:44.126Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9565/live/84c86010-2067-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9565/live/84c86010-2067-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kx1n3xgr2o,"Chancellor Rachel Reeves has signalled the UK could lower tariffs on US car imports as she tries to broker a trade deal with the Trump administration.

Reeves said she wants ""to see tariff and non-tariff barriers reduced between the UK and the US"".

The UK is seeking to lower trade taxes imposed by President Donald Trump of 25% for cars, steel and aluminium and 10% on other British exports.

One of the sticking points for a trade deal in the past has been food standards, but Reeves said the UK would not be reducing these.

Earlier today a document circulated among US business groups and unions seeking views on a potential deal with the UK, focused on lowering UK tariffs on US cars to 2.5% from their current 10%.

The chancellor suggested she was open to this to secure a wider trade deal.

President Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US – including from the UK.

The UK is also facing a broader tariff rate of 10%, and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies – most of which are currently on pause until July.

UK negotiators are working ""flat out"" to get an agreement that is in the country's national interest, Reeves told the BBC at an event in Washington.

""We are willing to reduce trade barriers in the UK, those trade barriers that do exist. And we want to build on the relationship that we have,"" she added later speaking at a Semafor event.

Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a ""good chance"" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.

Speaking to the BBC at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) event on Wednesday, Reeves said the UK was ""not going to rush into a deal"".

But she said the government was ""confident that working with our partners in the US we can get a better trading relationship and build on the substantial trade that already exists between our two great countries"".

""We want to get the right deal for Britain, to better support our industry, our jobs and consumers,"" she added.

Reeves said that the UK had been ""really clear"" in discussions with US negotiators ""that we're not going to be reducing agricultural standards in the UK"".

""The US administration respect and understand that we have high standards to support British farming, and to support British consumers, and we're not going to be relaxing those standards,"" she said.

Many American farmers use growth hormones as a standard part of their beef production, something that was banned in the UK and the European Union in the 1980s.

The US has previously pushed for a relaxation of rules for its agricultural products, including beef from cattle that have been given growth hormones.

Farmers in the UK warned ministers last week not to dilute British food standards, saying the use of hormones in rearing livestock cannot be accepted.

Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives would ""expect"" Reeves to stick to agricultural standards ""but let's see the detail as and when there is a deal"".

He said it is ""hugely important"" to ""get these 25% tariffs on cars and steel down"" but he said the government should be moving faster on negotiations.

""It's taken them a long time, in fact, to even have got in the room with the US administration to start discussing these issues, let alone getting a deal now,"" he said.

Trump has brought in a large number of tariffs on imports to the US, arguing they will boost US manufacturing and protect jobs.

These include, as part of an ongoing trade war, levies of up to 145% on Chinese goods. China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.

The move has rattled the world economy, sparking turmoil on global financial markets.

Prices are expected to rise for consumers in the US as a result of the tariffs, due to the companies importing goods passing on higher costs.

The IMF has cut its global growth forecast because of the uncertainty caused by tariffs, and says it expects US growth to be hit the hardest.

On Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK must take the risk of trade wars hitting global economic growth ""very seriously"".

However, Reeves said: ""I do understand the concerns the US has about countries around the world that run large and persistent trade surpluses with the US.""

She said the UK ""is not one of those countries"" so ""there is a deal there to be done between the UK and the US"".

She added that she understood ""the need to rebalance the global economy"".

This, in part, is why the UK announced on Wednesday a review of low-value imports coming into the UK which are ""undercutting the British High Street and British retailers"" she said.

This mirrors a US action, with the White House set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May.

It is set to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.

The removal of the so-called ""de minimis"" rule will hit companies including fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant.

Shein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices ""due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs"".

The UK government said that the UK Trade Remedies Authority (TRA) would be putting more resources into helping firms report unfair trade practices as part of its review.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kx1n3xgr2o

Asked about an upcoming meeting between the countries, Bessent said it would be an ""incredible opportunity"" to strike an agreement, if China was ""serious"" on making its economy less dependent on manufacturing exports.

""China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change because we need rebalancing too,"" he said.

The comments come as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies has escalated in recent weeks.

US President Donald Trump has brought in a number of tariffs on imports to the US which he has said are aimed at increasing US manufacturing and protecting jobs.

These include import taxes of up to 145% on Chinese goods, but China has hit back with a 125% tax on US products.

Speaking at the Institute of International Finance conference on Wednesday, Bessent, said it was a ""matter of impetus and will"".

""There is an opportunity for a big deal here, that the US is looking to rebalance to more manufacturing, the identity of that would be less consumption.

""If China is serious on less dependence on export-led manufacturing growth, and a rebalancing towards a domestic economy… if they want to rebalance, let's do it together.""

The comments come after Bessent reportedly said on Tuesday that heexpected a de-escalation of the trade warand that the current situation was ""not a joke"".

Trump has also said he is optimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".

Tensions between China and the US have shaken investors, with violent swings in share prices and sharp falls in the dollar.

Stocks surged on Wednesday on hopes that trade tensions between the US and China could soon ease.

Aside from the trade war, Bessent called on the IMF and the World Bank to refocus on the core missions of economic stability and development, arguing that they had strayed too far into vanity projects such as ""climate change, gender and social issue"".

""These issues are not the IMF's mission,"" he said.

Tensions between the countries have rattled financial markets, with both sides introducing strong tariffs on each other.

Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said that he was ""very frankly encouraged"" by Bessent's comments on the IMF and World Bank.

Although Mr Bessent said the IMF and the World Bank are ""falling short"" he did not call for the US to withdraw from the institutions as some conservatives have lobbied for.

He said the Trump administration will use US influence at these institutions and ""push them to accomplish their important mandates"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clywg25ykqno
The record-breaking tunnel being built from Denmark to Germany,The rail and road link will slash journey times between much of Scandinavia and continental Europe.,Europe,"World of Business, International Business, Germany, Denmark, Transport",Adrienne Murray,2025-04-22T23:04:17.616Z,2025-04-22T23:04:17.616Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a9d2/live/f6d90120-19e4-11f0-bff1-bba065990f72.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a9d2/live/f6d90120-19e4-11f0-bff1-bba065990f72.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy70y2x3xj6o,"A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.

Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.

It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.

The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.

The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called ""elements"".

""It's a huge facility here,"" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.

To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete.

Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France – burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.

""We are breaking records with this project,"" says Mr Vincentsen. ""Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.""

With a price-tag around €7.4bn ($8.1bn; £6.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with €1.3bn from the European Commission.

It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.

Once completed, the journey between Rødbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.

Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a ""greener"" shortcut for freight and passengers.

""It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,"" states Mr Vincentsen. ""Everybody's a winner,"" he claims. ""And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.""

Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.

""So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,"" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.

There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.

At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. ""As you can hear, it's quite thick,"" he says tapping on the metal.  ""When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.""

Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.

Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.

""We have to be very, very careful,"" emphasises Mr Wede. ""We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.""

Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.

With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.

A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.

""There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,"" he adds. ""But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.""

So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. ""They looked at it and said, ""Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.""

Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.

One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.

However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.

""We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,"" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.

When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.

According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  ""Ultimately, the users are going to pay,"" he says.

It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.

""The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,"" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. ""They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy70y2x3xj6o
Trump crypto soars as US president offers dinner to top holders,The meme coin's website says its 220 top investors will be invited to a gala event with the president.,Business,"International Business, Donald Trump, Cryptocurrency",João da Silva,2025-04-24T03:55:07.690Z,2025-04-24T04:55:23.210Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4fe0/live/a7382ac0-20b9-11f0-8795-4f2eeb44dbb2.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4fe0/live/a7382ac0-20b9-11f0-8795-4f2eeb44dbb2.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8g2kpzx0go,"The price of Donald Trump's cryptocurrency has soared after the US president promised to host two special events for its top investors.

The website for the $Trump meme coin says its 220 biggest holders will be invited to a private gala dinner with the president on 22 May, describing it as the ""most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world.""

According to crypto trading platform Coinbase, $Trump jumped by more than 70% after the announcement. But it remains well below the record high of more than $74 (£42.40) reached shortly after its launch in January.

The digital currency is one of several crypto-related ventures launched by businesses linked to Trump, who has called himself the ""crypto president"".

As well as the gala dinner, which will be held at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington DC, there will be ""an ultra-exclusive private VIP reception with the President"" for the top 25 coin holders, the coin's website said.

Trump tokens in circulation are currently worth a total of around $2.5bn. They were first released just days before his inauguration on 20 January.

The move wascriticised by several people in the crypto industry, with some calling it ""a stunt"".

First ladyMelania Trump also launched a cryptocurrencyon the eve of the inauguration.

Meme coins are often used by speculators to make money or to allow fans to show support to a celebrity or moment in internet culture.

Shortly after returning to the White House this year, Trump signed an executive order to create a presidential working group tasked with proposing new crypto laws and regulations.

He has also signed an order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include other digital currencies.

Those funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings.

This week, Trump's media companyannouncedplans to launch exchange traded-funds (ETFs).

The financial products to be launched by Trump Media & Technology Group, owner of the Truth Social platform, and its partners will include digital assets as well as stocks with a ""Made in America focus"".

China sends Boeing planes back to US over Trump tariffs,Boeing's boss says it's looking to sell 50 more planes China has on order to other countries.,World,"Boeing, Trump tariffs, Donald Trump, US politics",Simon Browning,2025-04-23T16:47:43.488Z,2025-04-23T17:00:19.743Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1c01/live/efe37430-2057-11f0-92a1-8d40fc72f60c.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1c01/live/efe37430-2057-11f0-92a1-8d40fc72f60c.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3evw059x04o,"China has sent back planes it ordered from the US in its latest retaliation over Trump tariffs, the boss of aircraft maker Boeing has said.

Kelly Ortberg said two planes had already been returned and another would follow after trade tensions between the two countries escalated.

Boeing's chief executive told CNBC that 50 more planes were due to go to China this year but their customers had indicated they will not take delivery of them.

The US put 145% tariffs on imports from China and it hit back with a 125% tax on US products.

Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said he wasoptimistic about improving trade relations with China, saying the level of tariffs he had imposed would ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".

However, Mr Ortberg said China ""have in fact stopped taking delivery of aircraft because of tariff environment"".

Boeing is America's largest exporter with about 70% of its commercial aircraft sales outside of the US.

Mr Ortberg said Boeing was assessing options to re-market 41 of the already built planes to other customers as there was high demand from other airlines.

He said there were nine planes not yet in Boeing's production system and he wanted to ""understand their intentions and if necessary we can assign to other customers"".

He added Boeing was ""not going continue to build aircraft for customers who will not take them"".



Later in the afternoon, Mr Ortberg told an investor call ""there is not a day that goes by that we're not engaged with either cabinet secretaries or either POTUS himself (President Trump) regarding the trade war between China and the USA.""

He added he was ""very hopeful we'll get to some negotiations"".

On Wednesday, America's Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference there was anopportunity for a ""big deal"" between the US and China on trade.

Asked about an upcoming meeting between the countries, Bessent said it would be an ""incredible opportunity"" to strike an agreement, if China was ""serious"" on making its economy less dependent on manufacturing exports.

Mr Ortberg also told investors others in the Boeing supply chain were now exposed to tariffs - mainly in Japan and Italy where universal tariffs of 10% are being implemented.

Brian West, Boeing's chief financial officer said during the call ""free trade policy is very important to us"" and Boeing will continue to work to with suppliers to ensure continuity.

Boeing has reported smaller losses for the first quarter of the year after it manufactured and delivered more planes.

Production had slumped in 2024 due to a series of crises and a strike by about 30,000 American factory workers.

Pressure builds on UK finances as Reeves pushes for US trade deal,"The government borrowed more than expected last year, placing more pressure on the public finances ahead of the full impact of US tariffs.",Business,"Economics, UK economy, UK government spending, Office for National Statistics",Faarea Masud,2025-04-23T06:06:31.938Z,2025-04-23T12:43:22.467Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2d0c/live/6c509cb0-2020-11f0-8ff6-2f179a342bec.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2d0c/live/6c509cb0-2020-11f0-8ff6-2f179a342bec.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly59dy4x7ko,"The government borrowed more than expected last year, placing more pressure on the public finances ahead of the full impact of US tariffs being felt on the UK economy.

Borrowing, the difference between spending and income from taxes, was £151.9bn in the year to March, up £20.7bn from the year before.

The official figures come as Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to push for potential trade deal with the US in Washington later to avoid import taxes hitting UK exports.

The higher levels of borrowing has added to growing expectations that Reeves could cut public spending or raise taxes later this year in order to stick to her self-imposed borrowing rules.

In response to the figures, Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, reiterated that the chancellor's rules on borrowing were ""non-negotiable"", adding that the government would ""never play fast and loose with the public finances"".

Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the borrowing overshoot ""even before the influence from the tariff chaos is felt"" raised the chances of ""more tax hikes"".

""Reeves may not be too far away from having to raise money again in the Autumn Budget, by cutting spending and/or raising taxes, to meet her fiscal rules,"" she added.

One of Reeves's main rules for the UK economy is not to borrow money to fund day-to-day spending.

But sluggish economic growth and higher interest rates on government borrowing in recent months have led to warnings that it will be difficult for the chancellor to stick to them without raising taxes.

The UK is one of many countries to be hit with tariffs on goods entering the US, with President Donald Trump looking to upend the long-established order of global trade in a bid to boost American manufacturing and jobs.

But Reeves is aiming to avoid the import taxes hitting UK exporters by agreeing a trade deal with the US. US Vice-President JD Vance has said there was a""good chance"" of a trade deal.

On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund, an influential global organisation, forecast that UK growth would be lower than previously expected for 2025 at 1.1%, down from 1.6%.

Governments like to see economic growth as it leads to more jobs and businesses being created, better living standards on average, and ultimately higher income through taxation.

The UK government has made growth its top priority, but the IMF said it would be stifled in part by tariffs on goods entering the US along with rising inflation and borrowing costs.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the government borrowed almost £15bn more than the £137.3bn expected in the year to March due to increased spending on pay and benefits.

Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said the rise in borrowing was despite the government receiving a ""substantial boost in income"" from taxation.

He added at the end of the financial year, debt remained ""close to the annual value of the output of the economy, at levels last seen in the early 1960s"".

The debt interest paid by the government increased to by £1.3bn to £4.3bn last month.

James Smith, a markets economist at ING, said the cost of government borrowing created a ""very challenging environment for the government""

""I think it puts pressure on them to potentially raise taxes again later this year,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.

Jones said the government was going ""through every penny of taxpayer money spent, line by line, for the first time in 17 years to tear out waste"".

But shadow chancellor Mel Stride called the borrowing figures ""alarming, but not surprising"", adding that they ""lay bare the price the British people are paying for Rachel Reeves' choices"".

Liberal Democrat treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper meanwhile called the figures ""damning"" and called on Reeves to scrap ""her disastrous jobs tax"".

"Driving test backlog to be cleared by next summer, minister says","Transport secretary Heidi Alexander said the government would provide at least 10,000 extra driving tests a month.",Business,UK driving licence,Charlotte Edwards,2025-04-23T08:59:22.688Z,2025-04-23T14:45:15.592Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c929/live/2d9f6bf0-2015-11f0-b50d-e5061257eefa.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c929/live/2d9f6bf0-2015-11f0-b50d-e5061257eefa.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kv8qw83gpo,"The transport secretary has pledged to reduce the number of learner drivers in England waiting more than five months to sit practical tests.

Heidi Alexander said the government would aim to clearthe backlogby next summer, providing at least 10,000 extra driving tests a month to help tackle the issue.

Currentdriving test wait timesare ""totally unacceptable"", she told parliament's transport committee on Wednesday.

There is a minimum six-month wait to book a driving test in several areas of the UK,according to data from the AA.

The transport secretary said the new measures would help reduce average waiting times to no more than seven weeks by summer 2026.

It means the government is set to miss its original target for waiting times by up eight months.

The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) had planned on cutting waiting times to seven weeks by the end of this year. It has blamed an ""increase in demand and a change in customers' booking behaviour"" for the backlog.

In order to tackle the delays, Alexander revealed plans to double training capacity so more driving examiners would be available.

She said she was also asking those in other DVSA roles who are qualified, but not longer examine, to temporarily ""return to the frontline"".

She said it would also reintroduce overtime pay incentives for everyone delivering driving tests.

A record 1.95 million tests were booked last year, but the government would now consult on changes to the test booking system, Alexander added.

She said there were plans to crackdown on test booking bots which she said were ""exploiting learners"".

Test booking bots are automated software which can act much faster than a human to rapidly book an appointment on the DVSA website.

Such bots can secure multiple test slots and some companies have used this technology to resell driving test slots at inflated prices.

Learner driver Millie Moyler is due to sit her test this summer - almost 18 months since she started looking for a slot in December 2023.

""It's had a massive impact on my life,"" the university student from High Wycombetold BBC Radio 5 Live.

Millie said she had been held back by the delay and was ""hopeful"" she would pass her long-awaited first try in July.

The wait for a test used to be a mere 10 weeks, according to driving instructor Sue Howe.

""But since Covid, it's just so difficult to get a test,"" she told the BBC on Wednesday.

The instructor from Swindon said a shortage of examiners was to blame: ""If they're short of examiners, they just can't produce the tests.""

Emma Bush, managing director of AA Driving School, welcomed the ""further details of how the DVSA will meet its target waiting time of seven weeks by the end of the year"".

""Learner drivers have been dealing with frustratingly long waiting times to book a driving test since the easing of pandemic related restrictions several years ago,"" she said.

""Many people, particularly young people, need to pass their driving test for their job or to access education. Unblocking the system by creating extra tests will help ensure people are not being held back due to a lack of a driving licence.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kv8qw83gpo
Elon Musk to step back from Doge as Tesla profits plunge,The tech boss says he intends to spend only one to two days a week on Trump administration matters.,Technology,"Elon Musk, International Business, Tesla, Donald Trump",Lily Jamali,2025-04-22T21:28:40.597Z,2025-04-23T09:16:40.196Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/54dd/live/0534ad00-200c-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/54dd/live/0534ad00-200c-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0x50yr46lo,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to ""significantly"" cut back his role in the US government after the electric car firm reported a huge drop in profit and sales for the start of this year.

Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.

But Musk said his ""time allocation to Doge"" would ""drop significantly"" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla.

His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world.

Temporary government employees, such as Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, is set to expire late next month.

But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely.

Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk ""as long as I could keep him"".

The tech boss said he would now ""be allocating far more of my time to Tesla"", but suggested he would not leave the Trump administration completely, calling the work ""critical"" and pledging to stay on ""as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful"".

On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%.

The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying ""changing political sentiment"" could meaningfully hurt demand.

Musk blamed the boycott of Tesla cars on people who would ""try to attack me and the Doge team"".

Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results.

Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. ""Rapidly evolving trade policy"" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company.

""This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,"" Tesla's quarterly update said.

Musk hasclashedon trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.

On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were ""still tough on a company where margins are low"".

""I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,"" he said.

Earlier this month, he called Navarro a ""moron"" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was ""not a car manufacturer"" but a ""car assembler, in many cases"".

Georg Ell, who knew Musk and was director for Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme that if the multi-billionaire ""focuses on the companies where he is extraordinary, I think people will focus once again on the quality of the product and experiences"".

""I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he's a pretty single-minded individual,"" added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase.

Tesla said artificial intelligence would contribute to future growth, though investors have been unconvinced by such arguments in the past.

Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations ""rock-bottom"" after the companysaidearlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years.

The firm faces fierce competition, Mr Coatsworth said, warning that potential disruption to global supply chains as a result of Trump's trade war also created risks.

""Tesla's problems are mounting,"" he said.

EU hits Apple and Meta with €700m of fines,"The tech giants have reacted with fury, accusing the EU of unfairly pursuing US companies.",Technology,"Social media, European Commission, Meta, Facebook, Apple, European Union",Imran Rahman-Jones,2025-04-23T10:59:44.793Z,2025-04-23T15:46:36.696Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10b2/live/30e26320-202f-11f0-8ff6-2f179a342bec.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10b2/live/30e26320-202f-11f0-8ff6-2f179a342bec.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm248vzg9jwo,"The European Union has ordered Apple and Meta to pay a combined €700m (£599m) in the first fines it has issued under legislation intended to curb the power of big tech.

It has issued a €500m (£428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined €200m (£171m) over how much choice users had to consent to data collection.

""We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,"" Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.

The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of ""attempting to handicap successful American businesses"" and Apple saying it was being ""unfairly targeted"" and forced to ""give away our technology for free.""

The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump.

The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of ""taking advantage"" of America.

EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were ""completely separate"", telling the BBC: ""This is about enforcement, it's not about trade negotiations.""

The White House has been contacted for comment.

The European Commission - the EU's executive - started both investigationslast yearunder a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

The case against Apple wasover its App Store.

The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this.

Meanwhile, Meta's fine was over the choices it offered on data collection.

Meta introduced a ""consent or pay"" model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, orpaying a monthly subscription.

The Commission says this model did not allow users to freely consent to how their data was used.

In November, Meta introduced another option, which the Commission says ""allegedly uses less personal data to display advertisements.""

The Commission is currently assessing the new option.

In both cases, the Commission says the size of the fine takes into account ""the gravity and duration of the non-compliance"".

Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines.

""Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,"" said Commissioner Teresa Ribera.

""As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules.""

Apple said the Commission had made ""a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.""

It also accused the Commission of ""[moving] the goal posts"" during their meetings.

Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses.

""This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,"" it said in a statement.

The fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction ofGoogle's €2.4bn finefrom last September.

But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation.

In February, Donald Trump's White House issueda memorandumcomplaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms.

""Today's decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,"" Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC.

Prof Witt said the disagreement was ""not so much about substantive antitrust principles,"" given the US government is itself takinga number of big tech companies to courtover alleged monopoly power.

They are more ""about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,"" she added.

One company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite.

They had along-running disputeover the distribution of their apps on Apple devices.

Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was ""great news for app developers worldwide"" ina thread on X.

He urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple's App Store, which charges fees for using its platform.

A US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision.

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission ""has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U.S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures.""

""The Commission's actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,"" it said.

The UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after adigital competition lawwas brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares.

""Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems andGoogle's general searchand search advertising services are currently being investigated for potentially having this status, and it is likely that other US tech giants and platforms will face similar investigations in the near future,"" said Andrew Maxwell, partner at law firm Freeths.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm248vzg9jwo
Trump hints at softening China tariffs and says no plan to sack Fed boss Jerome Powell,"His comments come amid a trade war with Beijing, and after his attacks on the US central bank's boss.",Business,"International Business, US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, Donald Trump",João da Silva,2025-04-23T01:25:44.870Z,2025-04-23T09:10:40.315Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2cde/live/64d8f980-2027-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2cde/live/64d8f980-2027-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86jyw5jp6go,"US President Donald Trump has appeared to soften his recent comments on China and the head of the US Federal Reserve after recent clashes as he pursues his economic agenda.

Trump said he has ""no intention of firing"" Jerome Powell after repeatedly criticising the head of the central bank, but added that he would like Powell to be ""a little more active"" on cutting interest rates.

Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump also said he was optimistic about improving trade relations with China.

He said the level of tariffs - or import taxes - that he had imposed on Chinese imports would ""come down substantially, but it won't be zero"".

The president's tariffs are an effort to encourage factories and jobs to return to the US. This is a pillar of his economic agenda - as is a cut in interest rates, aimed at reducing the cost of borrowing for Americans.

Trump has ratcheted the rate on Chinese goods up to 145% - sparking reciprocal measures from Beijing and warnings from economists about the global impact of a trade war.

In his comments to reporters on Tuesday, Trump said he would be ""very nice"" in negotiations with Beijing - in the hope of securing a trade deal.

Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly said he expected a de-escalation of the trade war, which he said was unsustainable. Responding to comments from China, he said the current situation was ""not a joke"".

The trade war has led to turbulence in financial markets around the world - to which Trump's comments on Powell have also contributed.

The Fed has not cut rates so far this year, after lowering them by a percentage point late last year, a stance Trump has heavily criticised.

Last week, the president intensified his attacks on the Fed chief, calling him ""a major loser"". The comments sparked a selloff of stocks, bonds and the US dollar - though markets have since been recovering from those losses.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Friday that Trump was looking into whether it would be possible to sack Powell - who he first nominated to lead the central bank in 2017. Powell was then renewed in 2021 by Joe Biden.

It is unclear whether Trump has the authority to fire the Fed chair. No other US president has tried to do so.

Most major Asian stock markets were higher on Wednesday as investors appeared to welcome the latest remarks.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose about 1.9%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed by around 2.2%, while mainland China's Shanghai Composite was down less than 0.1%.

That came after US shares made gains on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 ending Tuesday's session up 2.5% and the Nasdaq rose 2.7%.

US futures were also trading higher overnight. Futures markets give an indication of how financial markets will perform when they open for trading.

Investors feared that pressure on Powell to lower interest rates could cause prices to rise at a time when trade tariffs are already seen boosting inflation.

Trade tensions between the world's biggest economies, as well as US tariffs on other countries around the world, have triggered uncertainty about the global economy. Those concerns triggered turmoil in financial markets in recent weeks.

On Tuesday,the forecast for US economic growth for this yearwas given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by tariffs.

The sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a ""significant slowdown"" in global growth, the Fund predicted.

Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.

His administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.

China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to ""fight to the end"".

US dollar: Why should I care if the greenback falls?,Why movements in the US dollar have a massive impact internationally - and how it could affect you.,Business,"US economy, Trump tariffs, US Dollar (USD)",BBC News,2025-04-22T23:01:31.879Z,2025-04-22T23:01:31.879Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/54ff/live/1b9bfb40-1f74-11f0-8b6f-ed049b08c0a2.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/54ff/live/1b9bfb40-1f74-11f0-8b6f-ed049b08c0a2.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn1egyn4xo,"The US dollar has seen big declines in recent months.

Currencies rise and fall all the time but the recent drop in the dollar has been particularly dramatic.

So why has the dollar been falling and why does it matter?

The dollar was rising in the autumn in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election off the back of relatively strong US economic growth, and continued to strengthen after Trump's victory in November on hopes he might extend that trend.

Talk of his trade policy also had an effect, as many investors thought the tariffs that he promised to bring in would push up inflation, forcing the US central bank, the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or at least not cut them as fast as expected.

The prospect of higher rates in the US makes the dollar more attractive as it means investors will make more money on their cash in dollars compared to other currencies.

But the calculus has shifted in recent months as the details of his tariffs have emerged - often followed by pauses or, in the case of China, extensions - leaving much uncertainty surrounding the impact they will have.

US growth is now widely expected to weaken.

That has had a knock-on impact on the dollar, which has seen steep falls.Trump's attacks on Fed chief Jerome Powellfor not cutting interest rates also appear to have added pressure to the greenback.

The value of all currencies goes up and down influenced by many factors such as inflation expectations and central bank policies.

But the dollar index, which measures its strength against a set of currencies, has fallen to its lowest level for three years.

The dollar is usually seen as a safe investment in troubled times.

So the sharp drops in the currency - as well as the recent sell-off inUS government bonds, also generally considered a safe US asset - are unusual.

The fall in the dollar after Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs announcement was ""quite shocking"", says Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange (FX) strategy at Rabobank.

""For several years, the market's been buying this US growth story, the US stock market's been outperforming other stock markets, and suddenly you had economists thinking tariffs would push the US into recession,"" she says, pointing to the massive sell-off of US stocks, US bonds and the dollar.

That has raised speculation about whether the drop might signal a more far-reaching turn away from the US, as well as away from the dollar.

The first time ordinary Americans might notice a weaker dollar is when they go abroad, as their money will not go as far. While foreign tourists in the US will find their currency will buy them more.

But movements in the dollar also have a massive impact internationally, more so than swings in other currencies do.

That's because it is the world's primary reserve currency, meaning it is held by central banks around the world in large quantities as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Central banks use US dollars in international transactions, to pay for international debt, or to support domestic exchange rates.

The dollar is also the main currency used in international trade, with around half of world trade invoices done in US dollars, says Jane Foley.

A fall in the dollar means US goods exports become cheaper. But imported goods may become more expensive due to the weaker currency, as well as any direct impact from tariffs.

Many commodities that trade internationally, such as oil and gas, are also priced in dollars. A weaker dollar makes crude oil cheaper for countries that hold other currencies.

In the US a strong dollar has been seen as a symbol of American political might.

The very idea that it might lose its status as the world's reserve currency has been unthinkable.

Ms Foley says that while other currencies may become more important, the dollar won't lose its number one status any time soon, although one Federal Reserve official suggested last year thatthe US can no longer take this for granted.

Ms Foley thinks the dollar will win back some ground over the next few weeks but will not get back to where it was.

That's because with very significant market moves, there's always the possibility of profit taking. For instance, if investors decide to sell euros while they're trading strongly, that could lead to the euro falling and the dollar rising.

The markets will be watching this week to see if Trump continues his attack on the head of the Federal Reserve. He has called Mr Powell ""a major loser"" and has publicly called for his ""termination"".

If there is pressure on Powell to leave office, the markets will start to wonder about the Fed's credibility, something which is seen as crucial.

""The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,"" says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyn1egyn4xo
Trump tariffs: US forecast to be hit hardest of major economies,"The US suffers the biggest downgrade to growth among advanced economies, in the influential International Monetary Fund's latest forecast.",Business,"International Monetary Fund (IMF), Economy, Trump tariffs, Economic growth",Nick Edser,2025-04-22T13:01:03.161Z,2025-04-22T14:27:14.574Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5bf5/live/cb17bf50-1fdd-11f0-87dd-c9f70fa2007f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5bf5/live/cb17bf50-1fdd-11f0-87dd-c9f70fa2007f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx415erwkwo,"The forecast for US economic growth for this year has been given the biggest downgrade among advanced economies by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to uncertainty caused by trade tariffs.

Growth is now expected to be 1.8% this year, down from the IMF's estimate of 2.7% for the US in January.

The sharp increase in tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a ""significant slowdown"" in global growth, the Fund predicts.

The forecast for the UK has also been cut, with the economy now expected to grow by 1.1% this year.

But the IMF has predicted UK economic growth will be stronger than Germany, France, and Italy.

Inflation in the UK, however, will be the highest in the world's advanced economies, at 3.1% this year, largely due to higher bills, including for energy and water.

The predictions come as top economic policymakers gather in Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank.

IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said the global economy ""still bears significant scars"" from the ""severe shocks of the past four years"".

""It is now being severely tested once again,"" he added.

On Tuesday, US PresidentDonald Trump said he had ""no intention of firing"" Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powellafter heavily criticising him.

Concerns that Trump may try to sack Powell sparked a sell-off in markets in recent days.

Trump has made a flurry of announcements on tariffs this year - taxes charged on goods brought into the US from other countries.

In a growing trade war, the US has placed tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, while China has hit back with 125% levies on US products.

The US has also introduced a 10% tax rate on goods from the vast majority of other countries, while pausing much higher rates for dozens of nations for 90 days.

Trump says tariffs will encourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to huge levels of investment in the country.

However, the IMF highlighted the potential negative impact on global trade given that modern supply chains are so interlinked.

Uncertainty around trade policy was a ""major factor"" behind the growth downgrades, Mr Gourinchas said.

""Faced with increased uncertainty... many firms' initial reaction will be to pause, reduce investment and cut purchases.""

The IMF predicts the global economy will grow by 2.8% this year, down from its previous forecast of 3.3%, and by 3.0% in 2026.

The downgrade to the US growth forecast was due to greater policy uncertainty, trade tensions and slower than expected consumer spending, the IMF said. Tariffs are also expected to hit growth in 2026.

The IMF said there was now a 40% probability of a US recession this year, higher than its estimate of 25% in October last year.

Earlier on Tuesday, banking groupthe Institute of International Financesaid it expected ""a shallow recession"" in the US later this year, with negative growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2025.

China is expected to grow by 4% this year, down from the IMF's previous estimate of 4.6%.

In the UK, the downward revision reflects the impact of tariffs, higher government borrowing costs, and weaker consumer spending as a result of higher bills and energy costs.

However, the IMF's 2025 prediction for the UK is now close to the1% growth forecast by the government's Office for Budget Responsibility(OBR) last month. The IMF expects the UK to grow by 1.4% next year.

Responding to the forecast, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said it showed the UK was still the fastest growing European G7 country due to ""reform which will drive up long-term growth in the UK"".

Reeves added that ""the world has changed"" and she would be in Washington this week ""defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade"".

However, Mel Stride, the Conservative shadow chancellor, said the IMF outlook was ""a worrying indictment of Labour's economic approach"".

""The IMF has downgraded the UK's growth forecast, raising serious concerns about the lack of confidence and direction under Labour. They have also revised up significantly their forecast for inflation,"" he said.

The IMF's World Economic Outlook also contains the following forecasts:

Forecasts are never perfect given the many factors that affect economic growth, and the IMF acknowledged its latest predictions had been particularly challenging.

The figures given are what the IMF calls its ""reference forecast"" based on the situation as at 4 April, which was two days after Trump's announcement of wide-ranging tariffs.

Mr Gourinchas said that while the reference forecast was the IMF's central scenario, ""many possible paths exist, reflecting the unpredictability surrounding future trade policy and the varied impact of tariffs across different countries"".

The IMF also looked at the situation after the US temporarily suspended many tariffs while raising those on China sharply.

Mr Gourinchas said the tariff pause did not ""materially"" change the global outlook from its reference forecast, because the overall effective tariff rate of the US and China remains high and uncertainty about the policy continues.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx415erwkwo

The organisation predicted UK inflation would be the highest in the world's advanced economies this year at 3.1%, largely due to higher bills, including for energy and water.

The fund also said the UK economy would grow less than previously predicted, up 1.1% in 2025 instead of 1.6%, because of the global fallout from US trade tariffs.

The report comes as top economic policymakers meet in Washington this week at the IMF's spring gathering.

The downgrade in the outlook for the UK economy is neverthelessahead of predictions for France, Italy and Germany.

US President Donald Trump's tariffs, a steep increase in borrowing costs and a hit from inflation all contributed to the downgrade.

IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters that the IMF expected three more interest rate cuts by the Bank of England in 2025 after a quarter-point cut in February.

The report said that the spike in inflation expected this year would be a ""temporary phenomenon"" which would leave room for rate cuts.

However, Trump tariffs could also push down the pace of UK price rises as goods are diverted away from the US.

The IMF expects UK inflation to slow to 2.2% by 2026, close to the Bank's 2% target.

In response to the predictions, Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted how the IMF still saw stronger economic growth in the UK in 2025 than in Europe's other big countries.

""The report also clearly shows that the world has changed, which is why I will be in Washington this week defending British interests and making the case for free and fair trade,"" Reeves said.

She is due to meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent where she is expected to make Britain's case for a trade agreement with Washington that would lower or eliminate US tariffs on British goods.

The UK retailer said its Click and Collect service had been impacted by technical issues along with its ability to collect contactless payments - with many customers taking to social media to complain about delays.

M&S chief executive Stuart Machin apologised to customers in a note on Tuesday.

He said the company had been forced to temporarily make ""small changes"" to store operations ""to protect you and our business"".

""There is no need for you to take any action at this time and if the situation changes, we will let you know,"" he said.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's data watchdog, has been notified.

""Marks & Spencer plc has made us aware of an incident and we are assessing the information provided,"" an ICO spokesperson told the BBC.

In anotice to investors, M&S said it had engaged ""external cyber security experts to assist with investigating and managing the incident"".

""We are taking actions to further protect our network and ensure we can continue to maintain customer service,"" it added.

The company said it also reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre.

M&S told customers it was working to resolve some ""limited"" delays to Click and Collect orders.

It comes after some shoppers complained over the weekend about various issues - including being unable to use gift cards or vouchers in stores.

One person called the issues a ""total failure for customers""in a post on X.

""A simple message out to customers to save a journey would have worked a treat,"" they said.

And another said they wereunable to pay for clothes using a gift cardwhile shopping at a M&S store in Liverpool.

M&S has confirmed it is still experiencing technical difficulties affecting its ability to process gift cards, alongside Click and Collect orders.

Daniel Card of the Chartered Institute for IT (BCS) said the M&S incident was ""a reminder of the gap that often exists between our perception of cyber resilience and the reality"".

""Even well-resourced organisations aren't immune, which underlines the importance of action at every level,"" he said.

He said while this may feel daunting for some smaller organisations, many common vulnerabilities ""can be addressed through practical, proportionate steps"".

These may include securing devices and email accounts to protect from targeted attempts to compromise a person or business.

This is just the latest in a series of IT problems to hit major high street names.

Morrisonsexperienced significant problemswith their Christmas orders last year, with deliveries cancelled and discounts not applied on the biggest grocery shopping day of the year.

This was followed by two major outages on what was pay day for many in the first two months of this year.

And in January, serious IT problems at Barclaysaffected the bank's app and online banking.

It was later disclosed the firm could face compensation payments of £12.5m.

In February, several banks – notably Lloyds – faced outages,leaving businesses unable to pay staff.

Ian McShane, a security expert at cyber security company Arctic Wolf, said the issues experienced by M&S over Easter showed that ""cyber attackers never take a day off"".

""Criminals are always on the look out to cause the most disruption for the least amount of effort,"" he added.

""Given the long weekend is the second biggest trading event for food and drink retailers after Christmas, this is exactly what happened here as the majority of the British public enjoyed the long weekend.""

"US sets tariffs of up to 3,521% on South East Asia solar panels",Several Chinese solar companies with factories across the region could face steep new tariffs.,Business,"Solar power, International Business, Trade war, Global trade",João da Silva,2025-04-22T06:14:32.737Z,2025-04-22T06:49:22.270Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/933e/live/9c106800-1fe8-11f0-89df-fbfd5d939728.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/933e/live/9c106800-1fe8-11f0-89df-fbfd5d939728.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygdv47vlzo,"The US Commerce Department has announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on imports of solar panels from four South East Asian countries.

It comes after an investigation that began a year ago when several major solar equipment producers asked the administration of then-President Joe Biden to protect their US operations.

The proposed levies - targeting companies in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam - are in response to allegations of subsidies from China and the dumping of unfairly cheap products in the US market.

A separate US government agency, the International Trade Commission, is due to reach a final decision on the new tariffs in June.

The countervailing and anti-dumping duties, as these tariffs are known, vary between companies and the countries their products are made in.

Some solar equipment exporters in Cambodia face the highest duties of 3,521% because of what was seen as a lack of cooperation with the Commerce Department investigation.

Products made in Malaysia by Chinese manufacturer Jinko Solar faced some of the lowest duties of just over 41%.

Another China-based firm, Trina Solar, faces tariffs of 375% for the products it makes in Thailand.

Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment from BBC News.

In recent years, many Chinese firms have moved operations to South East Asia in a bid to avoid tariffs imposed since the start of US President Donald Trump's first term.

The US Commerce Department's findings were welcomed by the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee - a group of manufacturers that called on the US government to launch the investigation.

""This is a decisive victory for American manufacturing and confirms what we've long known: that Chinese-headquartered solar companies have been cheating the system,"" said Tim Brightbill, lead counsel to the Alliance.

In 2023, America imported almost $12bn (£8.9bn) in solar equipment from the four countries, according to US Census Bureau figures.

While the planned tariffs are likely to help US solar panel manufacturers, they could also mean extra costs for businesses and consumers who have benefited from the availability of cheaper solar products.

The levies would be imposed on top of other tariffs already rolled out by the Trump administration.

The planned tariffs were announced just days after Chinese President Xi Jinping completed a tour of Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia.

The trip was aimed to boost ties with the region and encourage those nations to resist what he called ""unilateral bullying"" by the US.

Trump has so far imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.

His administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.

China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US and vowed to ""fight to the end"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygdv47vlzo

The oil engineer has held an account with Revolut for several years - using its app to split bills with friends after going out for dinner or drinks. They would pay each other using traditional currency, like the pound sterling or US dollar.

But after seeing the e-money firm advertise its cryptocurrency services, he decided to give it a try.

What Tzoni thought would be a straightforward transfer of cryptocurrency coins has left the Bulgarian national angry and out of pocket.

His experience highlightssome of the frustrations people have had using cryptocurrencywhere many of the customer safeguards which underpin standard online banking transactions, some mandated by law, do not apply.

""When they treat you like this, it makes you feel like you can't do anything,"" he told BBC News. ""Like you are powerless.""

While thecryptocurrency market is dominated by Bitcoin,there is a plethora of other digital currencies, including USDC - which Tzoni had already amassed in a separate crypto account.

His frustrations began in February when he decided to transfer some of his USDC coins to his Revolut account.

As a precaution - which Revolut suggests doing - he first sent 10 of the coins, worth $10. It was a success and the funds were credited to his Revolut account.

Days later he tried to make a larger transfer of what he thought was 1,500 USDC. The transfer was completed but, this time, the funds were not credited to his account.

Tzoni says the problem occurred because Revolut's deposit instructions were unclear.

When you transfer cryptocurrency from one account to another, you have to select a network to send it through - like choosing which courier service to use when sending a parcel.

Revolut's deposit instructions say to transfer USDC to it, you have to use a network called Polygon. In his first, successful, deposit Tzoni selected one called ""Polygon PoS"".

In the second deposit, when he tried to transfer 1,500 USDC, he selected a different network - ""Polygon (bridged)"".

He thought it would work just as well but says instead it caused the coins to be converted into USDC.e - a different cryptocurrency.

This is what Revolut received. The company does not handle USDC.e coins.

After seeing his Revolut account had not been credited with the 1,500 coins, Tzoni contacted the Revolut support team.

In messages seen by BBC News, they told him the issue seemed to be with ""the specific type of Polygon network used, which led to the conversion"".

In another, he was told: ""The app currently specifies 'Polygon' without differentiating between standard and bridged options. I'll note your feedback for future improvements.""

Tzoni thinks if Revolut's deposit instructions had been more specific, his problem would have been avoided.

When approached by BBC News about this case, Revolut gave a different answer.

The firm said the problem was not because Tzoni had used the wrong Polygon network - which he claimed turned his coins into USDC.e.

The deposit failure was ""not because the network itself had 'converted' the token"", it said, without explaining why its support team had suggested to Tzoni that it was.

Revolut told us the deposit ultimately failed because the USDC.e coins it received were not supported by the company's technology.

It said: ""As is standard industry practice due to the significant technical challenges involved in supporting every combination of token and chain, the recovery of these unsupported assets does not sit within Revolut's scope.""

It means the 1,500 USDC.e coins have not been credited to Tzoni's account or sent back to him.

To Tzoni's mind, this isn't acceptable treatment froma company of Revolut's size and reputation,which handles normal banking deposits as well as cryptocurrency, stocks and commodities.

Revolut says it has 10 million users in the UK while last year it was granted a provisional banking licence, paving the way for it to become a fully fledged UK bank.

When using a High Street bank, a mistaken transfer of traditional currency would usually be resolved with the money being reverted back to the customer.

This was established in 2014 in a voluntary code of practice that most UK banks signed up to. There is no such equivalent in the cryptocurrency industry.

After contacting Revolut several times in recent weeks, Tzoni has been told the coins are effectively lost.

""They are waiting for me to get bored and give up, to accept the money is gone. But I won't,"" Tzoni said, pointing out the coins are in the Revolut system. ""It is ridiculous that they can behave like this.""

While Tzoni's loss of cryptocurrency is significant to him, the sum is tiny compared with the size of the industry, which has risen sharply in value over the past 18 months.

The global market peaked in value at $3.9tn last December, following the re-election of Donald Trump. Since then it has fallen by $1.1tn, according to tracking website CoinGecko.

Government policies in the US and other countries are alsochanging to favour the cryptocurrency industry,even though it has suffered several scandals.

FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency firms, went bankrupt in 2022.Sam Bankman-Fried, its chief executive, was sentenced to 25 years in prisonlast year for defrauding customers of billions of dollars.

Investigators also found FTX was using QuickBooks, a popular accounting software designed for individuals and small businesses, to manage the money.

John Ray III, a lawyer tasked with recovering funds from FTX for defrauded customers, told a bankruptcy court: ""Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.""

He later told a congressional hearing: ""Nothing against QuickBooks. It's a very nice tool, just not for a multibillion-dollar company.""

A couple of months ago Bybit, the world's second largest cryptocurrency exchange by some estimates, was tricked out of$1.5bn worth of coins by hackers thought to be working for North Korea.

The firm had been using Safe, a free digital storage software popular with individuals who want to store cryptocurrency on their own devices, as part of their business operations.

Following the theft, Bybit's chief executive said they ""should have upgraded and moved away from Safe"" earlier.

One of the problems with cryptocurrency firms, says Prof Mark Button, who researches cybercrime, is they can grow very quickly, which means they don't always keep up with the accounting and security challenges of managing so much money.

""For me it illustrates that if we are going to be serious about cryptocurrencies in the future… there needs to be some kind of regulation.""

In Tzoni's case, it might have been easier for him to get his cryptocurrency back or be compensated if there were laws stating what firms need to do if they are sent a coin they don't handle.

Higher industry standards might also have prevented him making such a transaction in the first place.

Mykhailo Tiutin is chief technology officer at AMLBot, a company that analyses how risky cryptocurrency transactions are.

Their service runs checks similar to those supported by banks, where details for a transfer, such as the account holder's name, sort code and account number, are verified.

He says cryptocurrency is safe enough for the average person to use but that they should be careful about which products and services they choose. He says he has also lost cryptocurrency after making an administrative mistake.

""You have to do your own research,"" he told us. ""The successes and the losses are ultimately at your own risk.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93gydxj8n7o

In a social media post, Trump called on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates ""pre-emptively"" to help boost the economy, saying Powell had been consistently too slow to respond to economic developments.

""There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,"" he wrote.

Trump's criticism of Powell's handling of the US economy comes as his own plans for tariffs have driven a stock market sell-off and raised fears of economic recession.

The president's intensifying clash with Powell, whom he named to lead the Fed during his first term, has added to the market turmoil.

The S&P 500, which tracks 500 of the biggest US companies, fell roughly 2.4% on Monday. It has lost roughly 12% of its value since the start of the year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.4% and has dropped about 10% so far this year, while the Nasdaq fell more than 2.5% and is down roughly 18% since January.

However, on Tuesday, trading on most major stock indexes in the Asia-Pacific region was subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed around 0.1% lower, and the ASX 200 in Sydney closed around 0.3% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed about 0.3% higher.

In European early trading, the UK's FTSE 100 stock exchange was marginally lower by about 0.05%, while Germany's Dax wasdown around 0.5% and France's CAC was down 0.6%.

Though the US dollar and US government bonds are typically considered safe assets in times of market turmoil, they have not escaped the recent turbulence.

The dollar index - which measures the strength of the dollar against a set of currencies including the euro - on Monday fell to its lowest level since 2022.

Interest rates on US government debt also continued to rise on Tuesday, as investors demanded higher returns for holding Treasuries.

Meanwhile, the price of gold hit a new all-time record high, breaking the $3,500 (£2,613) per ounce mark as investors seek out so-called ""safe haven"" assets.

The precious metal is viewed as a safer place to put money during times of economic uncertainty.

Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said as well as tariffs, gold's appeal had also increased due there being ""no long-term resolution in sight for conflicts around the world, particularly in Ukraine and Gaza"".

""There are also concerns about the risk that geo-political tensions escalate as opportunities in the Arctic are eyed by the US and Russia,"" she added.



Trump's criticism of Powell dates back to his first term in office, when he also reportedly discussed firing him. Since winning the election, he has urged Powell to lower borrowing costs.

The latest criticism follows Powell's warnings that Trump's import taxes were likely to drive up prices and slow the economy.

Trumplast week called publicly for Powell to be fired, writing on social media on Thursday: ""Powell's termination cannot come fast enough.""

Such a move would be controversial - and legally questionable - given a tradition of independence at the bank.

Powelllast year told reportershe did not believe the president had the legal authority to remove him.

But one of Trump's top economic advisers confirmed that officials were studying the option on Friday, when the stock market in the US was closed for trading.



Trump's latest comments come as top economic policymakers are gathering in Washington for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.

Christopher Meissner, a professor of economics at University of California, Davis, and who formerly worked with the IMF, told the BBC's Today programme that before the 1970s there was ""significant"" political pressure on the Federal Reserve from time to time.

""However, the past 30 or 40 years what we've learned is that central bank independence is the key to financial stability and low inflation. And I think this is a major reversal and we have to watch out for it,"" he added.

""The independence of central banks is seen as critical to ensure long-term price stability, ringfencing policymakers from short-term political pressures,"" added Ms Streeter, of Hargreaves Lansdown.

The IMF will publish its latest growth forecasts for individual countries later, and last weekit said these projections would include ""notable markdowns"".

Mr Meissner said: ""They used to say 'When the US sneezed, the rest of the world caught a cold'. It'll be really curious to see if that continues.

""However, I think people are expecting a pretty significant downturn in the US in the coming months... and that can't be good for the rest of the world.""

Ms Streeter said that Trump's policies had damaged the reputation of the US, which is ""no longer being seen as a calmer port in a storm"".

""Yields on 10–year US Treasuries have held onto their recent rise above 4.4%. It's another sign of unease about the direction of the US economy, amid worries that policies playing out could keep inflation higher and slow growth, and flags the anxiety rattling through the markets right now,"" she added.

Gatwick Airport worst in UK for flight delays for second year,Departures from Gatwick Airport were an average of more than 23 minutes behind schedule in 2024.,England,"Manchester Airport, Travel, Birmingham Airport, Civil Aviation Authority, Gatwick Airport, Belfast City Airport, Air travel",Daniel Sexton,2025-04-21T00:52:21.372Z,2025-04-21T05:57:31.886Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c2b9/live/49f20f60-1e76-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c2b9/live/49f20f60-1e76-11f0-80b3-83959215671c.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9rze9k9no,"Gatwick has retained its position as the UK's worst airport for flight delays, as it continues to suffer from air traffic control (ATC) disruption, data shows.

Departures from the West Sussex airport, which mainly serves London, were an average of more than 23 minutes behind schedule in 2024, according to Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data.

This is an improvement from the more than 27 minutes during the previous 12 months - but is still longer than at any other UK airport.

A Gatwick Airport spokesperson said: ""Air traffic control restrictions in other parts of Europe have continued to impact the airport. Together with our airlines, we've put in place a robust plan... to improve on-time performance further in 2025.""

Gatwick, which is the UK's second busiest airport, was badly affected by ATC staff shortages across continental Europe in 2024, suffering the same issue in its own control tower.

Flights from Stansted Airport had the second poorest punctuality record last year, with an average delay of more than 20 minutes, while in third place was Manchester Airport with a similar average delay time.

Belfast City Airport recorded the best punctuality performance in the UK for the second year in a row, with an average delay per flight of under 12 minutes.

Depending on the distance of the route and length of delay, passengers booked on flights from UK airports which are running behind schedule may be entitled to compensation.

However, ATC issues are considered to be an ""extraordinary circumstance"", meaning affected passengers are not entitled to compensation.

The Gatwick spokesperson said the airport was ""the world's most efficient single-runway airport, with flights departing or arriving every 55 seconds"".

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said in February that she was prepared to support Gatwick's expansion plan to bring its emergency runway into routine use, if the project is adjusted.

The airport has until Thursday to respond.

A Manchester Airport spokesperson says it is ""committed to doing everything in our power to support all our carriers to achieve the best possible on-time departure rates"".

Trump tariffs: China warns nations against 'appeasing' US in trade deals,Beijing was responding to reports that the US will pressure other nations to restrict trade with China.,Business,"International Business, Trump tariffs, Trade war",João da Silva,2025-04-21T02:15:59.470Z,2025-04-21T05:41:13.888Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/beff/live/a8618e90-1e53-11f0-85cc-67568620b395.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/beff/live/a8618e90-1e53-11f0-85cc-67568620b395.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2708dl9n1o,"China has warned it will hit back at countries that make deals with the US that hurt Beijing's interests, as the trade war between the world's two biggest economies threatens to drag in other nations.

The comments come after reports that the US plans to pressure governments to restrict trade with China in exchange for exemptions to US tariffs.

The Trump administration has started talks with trading partners over tariffs, with a Japanese delegation visiting Washington last week and South Korea is set to start negotiations this week.

Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed hefty taxes on Chinese imports, while other countries have also been hit with levies on their goods.

""Appeasement cannot bring peace, and compromise cannot earn one respect,""a Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson said.

""China firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests. If this happens, China will never accept it and will resolutely take countermeasures"".

The remarks echoedan editorial last week in the state-controlled China Daily, which warned the European Union against trying to ""appease"" the US.

The comments came after reports that the US plans to use tariff negotiations to pressure dozens of countries into imposing new barriers on trade with China.

The BBC has asked the US Treasury Department and the US Trade Representative for responses to the reports.

Trump has said more than 70 countries have reached out to start negotiations since the tariffs were announced.

""If you put the numbers on it, about 20% of Japan's profitability comes from the United States, about 15% comes from the People's Republic of China,"" said Jesper Koll, from Japanese online trading platform operator Monex Group.

""Certainly, Japan doesn't want to [have to] choose between America and the People's Republic of China.""

Japan kicked off negotiations with the US last week when its top tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, met the US President in Washington DC.

South Korea's acting president, Han Duck-soo, has said his country will begin trade talks with the US later this week.

Meanwhile, US Vice President, JD Vance, is expected to meet India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi duringa visit to the countrythis week. India faces a tariff rate of 26% if it is unable to agree a trade deal with the Trump administration.

Last week, Vance said there was a""good chance"" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.

""We're certainly working very hard with Keir Starmer's government,"" he said in an interview with the UnHerd website.

Since Trump's inauguration, there has been a flurry of announcements on tariffs.

The US president has said the import taxes willencourage US consumers to buy more American-made goods, increase the amount of tax raised, and lead to major investments in the country.

But critics have said bringing manufacturing back to the US is complicated and could take decades and that the economy will struggle in the meantime.

Trump has also backtracked on many of his announcements.

Just hours after steep levies on dozens of America's trading partners kicked in earlier this month, he announceda 90-day pauseon those tariffs to all countries bar China, in the face of mounting opposition from politicians and the markets.

Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.

His administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.

China has hit back with a 125% tax on products from the US andvowed to ""fight to the end"".

The talks are likely to focus on fast tracking a much-awaited bilateral trade deal between the two countries.

Vance  is also expected to go on a sightseeing tour of Agra and Jaipur with his family.

His visit comes as countries across the world rush to negotiate trade deals before US President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs ends on 9 July.

""The two sides will also exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest,"" India's foreign ministry said ahead of Vance's visit.

The vice-president is accompanied by his children and wife Usha Vance whose parents migrated to the US from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.

After his arrival in Delhi on Monday morning, Vance visited the Akshardham temple complex in the city.

He is due to meet the Indian prime minister for formal talks later in the day and Modi is to host Vance for dinner in the evening.

The visit comes amid escalating trade tensions between Washington and several countries after Trump announced steep reciprocal tariffs on them.

Trump, who has repeatedly called Delhi a tariff abuser, had announced a tariff of 27% on India before he temporarily paused it on 9 April.

India has already slashed tariffs on some US goods, with further cuts expected as the balance of trade is still stacked heavily in favour of Delhi, which enjoys a $45bn trade surplus.

India's average tariffs of around 12% are also significantly higher than the US's 2%.

Until recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn (£144bn).

Prime Minister Modi was among the first leaders to meet Trump after his inauguration. Modi hailed a ""mega partnership"" with the United States following his meeting with the president.

Trump and Modi set an ambitious target to more than double bilateral trade to $500bn, as the two leaders announced a deal for India to import more from America, including oil and gas.

Weeks later, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard visited India, followed by a US delegation led by Assistant Trade Representative for South and Central Asia Brendan Lynch.

Vance's India tour is also seen as significant as Trump is likely to visit the country later this year for the Quad summit, which will also host leaders of Australia and Japan.

Speaking about Vance's engagements in India, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal last week said Delhi was ""very positive that the visit will give a further boost to our bilateral ties"".

The delivery giant said it will temporarily stop shipments from companies in all countries to American consumers on Monday ""until further notice"".

It added that business-to-business shipments will still go ahead, ""though they may also face delays"".

Previously, packages worth up to $2,500 could enter the US with minimal paperwork but due to tighter customs checks that came into force alongside Trump's tariffs earlier this month, the threshold has been lowered.

DHL said that the change ""has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, which we are handling around the clock"".

It said that while it is working to ""scale up and manage this increase, shipments worth over $800, regardless of origin, may experience multi-day delays"".

The company said it will still deliver packages worth less than $800, which can be sent to the US with minimal checks.

But the White House is set to clamp down on deliveries under $800 - specifically those sent from China and Hong Kong - on 2 May when it closes a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without incurring any duties.

The removal of the so-called ""de minimis"" rule will impact the likes of the fast-fashion firm Shein and Temu, the low-cost retail giant.

Shein and Temu have both warned that they will increase prices ""due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs"".

The Trump administration has claimedthat ""many shippers"" in China ""hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the US through deceptive shipping practices"".

Under an excutive order, the White House said the measures were aimed at ""addressing the synthetic opioid supply chain"" which it said ""play a significant role in the synthetic opioid crisis in the US"".

Beijing has said that the opioid fentanyl is a ""US problem"" and China has the strictest drug policies in the world.

Last week, Hongkong Post said it was suspending packages sent to the US by sea and, from 27 April, would stop accepting parcels destined for America.

It said: ""The US is unreasonable, bullying and imposing tariffs abusively.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jx9ep5l63o

Founder Justine Roberts said Ocado ""abruptly pulled out"" of the partnership after Mumsnet called at the last election for the act to be reformed ""to ensure women can access single-sex places"".

Ms Roberts said she had ""feared the site might not survive"" because of the number of advertisers which withdrew support over the discussion of gender issues on its forums.

Her post came after the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesdaythat a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act.

Mumsnet's call for reform would have allowed for spaces to be reserved for biological women.

Ms Roberts said the forum had also made ""repeated attempts to explain our position - as a platform committed to amplifying women's voices"" but Ocado had ""refused to speak to us"".

In a post on X, Ocado said the comments were ""not representative of us as a company"" and that they were made by a ""temporary contractor"" who has since left.

""We apologise unreservedly to Mumsnet,"" the online grocery site added.

Ms Roberts wrote her post in a discussion on the forum about the Supreme Court ruling. In the post, she congratulated those on the website ""who played a part in securing what I think most would agree is much-needed clarity in the Equality Act"".

The ruling was on a case campaign group For Women Scotland brought against the Scottish government, arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female.

Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.

Mumsnet's policy of allowing discussion of gender issues over a number of years had led to intense criticism, Ms Roberts said, adding that the site ""risked being permanently labelled as bigoted, vicious, and 'on the wrong side of history'"".

She claimed that a number of organisations had pulled their advertising over pressure from trans activists, both ""internal and external"", threatening the survival of the site.

Ms Roberts added the site ""never considered banning discussion of this issue altogether"".

US bond markets: Why everyone is watching them closely ,"What is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected. ",Business,"US economy, Trump tariffs, Global trade, Donald Trump",Michael Race,2025-04-19T01:06:12.015Z,2025-04-19T08:14:54.066Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8e35/live/0835d130-1a3c-11f0-a020-db6d78ff6ddb.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8e35/live/0835d130-1a3c-11f0-a020-db6d78ff6ddb.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg838qq7zqo,"Stock markets around the world have been relatively settled this week after a period of chaos, sparked by US trade tariffs.

But investors are still closely watching a part of the market which rarely moves dramatically - the US bond market.

Governments sell bonds - essentially an IOU - to raise money for public spending and in return they pay interest.

Recently, in an extremely rare movethe rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell.

The volatility suggests investors were losing confidence in the world's biggest economy.

You may think it's too esoteric to bother you, but here's why it matters and how it may change President Trump's mind on tariffs.

When a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - known as ""Treasuries"" in the US -  to investors on financial markets.

Such payments are made over a number of pre-agreed years before a full and final payment is made when the bond ""matures"" - in other words, expires.

Investors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks like the Bank of England.

Investors buy government bonds because they are seen as a safe place to invest their money. There is little risk a government will not repay the money, especially an economic superpower like the US.

So when the economy is turbulent and investors want to take money out of volatile stocks and shares markets, they usually place that cash in US bonds.

But recently that hasn't happened.

Initially, following the so-called ""Liberation Day"" tariffs announcement on 2 April when shares fell, investors did appear to flock to US bonds.

However, when the first of these tariffs kicked in on 5 April and Trump doubled down on his policies that weekend,investors began dumping government bonds, sending the interest rate the US government would have to pay to borrow money up sharply.

The so-called yield for US government borrowing over 10 years shot up from 3.9% to 4.5%, while the 30-year yield spiked at almost 5%. Movements of 0.2% in either direction are considered a big deal.

Why the dramatic sell-off? In short, the uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on the US economy led to investors no longer seeing government bonds as such a safe bet, so demanded bigger returns to buy them.

The higher the perceived risk, the higher the yield investors want to compensate for taking it.

If the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself.

But it can also have a direct impact on households and even more so on businesses.

John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, says when investors charge higher rates to lend the government money, other rates for lending that have more risk attached, such as mortgages, credit cards and car loans, also tend to rise.

Businesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.

Mr Canavan adds that banks can become more cautious in lending money, which could impact the US economy.

First-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs, he says, which could impact the housing market in the longer term. It's common in the US for small business owners starting out to use the equity in their home as collateral.

Following the introduction of tariffs, Trump urged his nation to ""hang tough"", but it appears the potential threat to jobs and the US economy stopped the president in his tracks.

Following the ructions in the bond markets, he introduced a 90-day pause for the higher tariffs on every country except China. The 10% blanket tariff, however, on all countries remains.

It proved a pressure point for Trump - and now the world knows it.

""Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,"" says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.

According to US media reports, it was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, who played a key part in swaying Trump.

The bond market reaction has led to comparisons with former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's infamous mini-Budget of September 2022. The unfunded tax cuts announced then spooked investors, who dumped UK government bonds, resulting in the Bank of England stepping in to buy bonds to save pension funds from collapse.

Some analysts suggested that America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, might have been forced to step in if the sell-off had worsened.

While bond yields have settled, some might argue the damage has already been done as they remain higher than before the blanket tariffs kicked in.

""Arguably the most worrying aspect of the [recent] turmoil... is an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar, akin to what the UK experienced in 2022,"" according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.

But unless you're a first-time buyer or selling your home, Americans are unlikely to be immediately hit by higher mortgage costs, unlike Brits who were securing new shorter-term fixed deals.

Since 2010, foreign ownership of US bonds has almost doubled, rising by $3 trillion, according to Deutsche Bank.

Japan holds the most US Treasuries, but China, the US's arch enemy in this global trade war, is the second biggest holder of US government debt globally.

Questions were raised about whether it sparked the debt sell-off in response to being hit with huge tariffs.

However, this is unlikely as any fire sale ""would impoverish China more than it would hurt the US"", according to Capital Economics.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg838qq7zqo
Mortgages: Five ways for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder,Mortgage experts share their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.,Business,"Personal finance, Housing market, Mortgages",Marc Ashdown,2025-04-21T00:31:54.914Z,2025-04-21T00:31:54.914Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b027/live/2de88440-1b72-11f0-b015-f17d4d024f76.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/b027/live/2de88440-1b72-11f0-b015-f17d4d024f76.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7n9441r5o,"Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people.

Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.

We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.

The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is £34,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.

A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each £4,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra £1,000.

Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.

""If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up £22,000 in free bonuses,"" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.

""Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of £450,000.""

Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.

In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008,according to new figures.

""Yorkshire Building Society offers a £5,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,"" says Mr Hollingsworth.

""Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.""

However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.

Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a ""share"" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.

Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as ""staircasing"" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.

""Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,"" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.

""The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.""

The ""Bank of Mum and Dad"" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.

An ""income boost"" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender.

While the ""boosters"" are on the mortgage, they are not owners of the home and therefore the buyer's first-time buyer status is not affected.

""This is increasingly popular amongst younger first-time buyers who are earlier in their careers and are earning less,"" says Richard Dana from Tembo.

""It's the primary option for families who want to support their children, but might not have the cash available to gift as a deposit, or want to keep hold of cash savings for their retirement or a rainy day.""

As buyers will be borrowing more than they would qualify for on their own, they should make sure they can afford the repayments.

The risk for the ""boosters"" is that they are jointly liable for the mortgage in the event the buyer is unable to make repayments.

Many lenders offer ""professional"" mortgages which could enable a buyer working in a regulated or accredited profession - such as doctors, architects and accountants - to borrow up to six times their income.

Specialist lenders also offer deals to particular professions.

For instance, Teachers Building Society works with those in the teaching profession, while Kensington offers a better earnings calculation to NHS staff, police officers, firefighters and teachers.

""Given that these career profiles are often more secure, Kensington felt it could be more generous in its approach as long as the mortgage will be affordable,"" says David Hollingworth.

""It can also take account of overtime and income from a second job to help improve the borrowing amount.""

But he adds: ""It's always still important to shop around. Rates on these mortgages can be a little higher, so taking advice on the best overall fit is important.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7n9441r5o
Firms say Meta not helping them to recover hacked accounts,Businesses around the world say they are unable to get back into their Facebook and Instagram pages.,N/A,"Social media, Computer hacking, World of Business, Instagram, International business, Technology",Jane Wakefield,2025-04-16T23:02:02.022Z,2025-04-16T23:02:02.022Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/28a1/live/0c065980-1931-11f0-869a-33b652e8958c.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/28a1/live/0c065980-1931-11f0-869a-33b652e8958c.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74zdm4kewlo,"When wedding dress designer Catherine Deane saw her company's Instagram account get hacked, she says it was ""devastating"".

""It felt like the rug had been pulled from under us. Instagram is our primary social platform, and we've invested the most amount of time and business resources into it.

""To keep the account current we post content every day. Suddenly all this work… it was just pulled.""

Ms Deane's UK-based business, which is named after her, sells wedding dresses online, with her biggest market being the US.

On Instagram it now has 59,000 followers, but a few years ago the firm lost control of the account after a member of its social media team received a message suggesting that the business had been selected to get blue-badge verification from Instagram, which is owned by Facebook's Meta.

This was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. ""We were obviously very excited about that,"" she says.

So her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers.

What added to Ms Deane's anguish was that she says she had to fight with Meta to get her account back, which took four months.

Initially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken.

""It's so incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,"" she says. ""It's almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it.""

Eventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page.

In the end the matter was finally resolved for Ms Deane because someone in the firm had a contact at Facebook, and the team emailed that person daily for the four months.

""Finally, I think they just needed to get us off their backs and they reinstated the account,"" says Ms Deane.

According to Jonas Borchgrevink, boss of US-based cyber security firm Hacked.com, Ms Deane is far from a unique case among people with business accounts on Instagram and Facebook.

""I would say that it is a massive problem,"" says Mr Borchgrevink. ""There are probably thousands every day that are losing their business pages.""

His company helps firms recover their Instagram and Facebook accounts, and he gets ""10 to 15 clients per week"". ""But those are just the ones that know about us and are able to pay the price, because these cases can take up to six months to sort.""

The BBC asked Meta to provide some numbers that would reveal the extent of the problem, and how it was tackling it, but it declined.

However, it said in a statement, that ""we take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two factor authentication and to be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details.

""We also have a feature called Security Check-up to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure.""

Hackers want to take over business social media accounts for a number of reasons. These including using the pages to sell fake products or place scam adverts, harvesting personal information, spreading malware, tricking people into sending money, or blackmailing the company in question to unblock the account.

The final thing in that list happened last year to David Davila, who is part of the marketing team at Quantum Windows & Doors, a small, family-run business based in Washington state in the US.

He got locked out of the firm's social Facebook account when he responded to what turned out to be a fake message purporting to be from Meta.

Because his phone number was linked to the account, that also fell into the hands of the scammers and, soon after the lock-out, he got a WhatsApp message demanding $1,200 (£900) to unlock the account.

Unable to find a helpline, he searched on Google, but the number he rang put him through to more scammers. That link has since been removed by Google.

Thankfully, Mr Davila was able to get the Facebook account unlocked a few days later.

Mr Borchgrevink believes that Meta is overwhelmed by the scale of the problem.

""It has implemented different security measures over the years and yet we still receive the same amount of clients, so I don't think there's been a lot of change there,"" he says.

In fact, with scammers now utilising AI to make their messages seem even more believable, Mr Borchgrevink  thinks the situation could get a lot worse.

He tells the BBC that scammers are behind many of these lock-outs and one of their preferred methods of fooling people is to masquerade as customer support agents.

""They pretend to be Meta Support and send the business an email saying that they have infringed some kind of copyright or broken terms and conditions in some way, and that they need to verify themselves.

""The messages have the Facebook logo and are very believable. But when you start to verify your business page, they ask for the password and redirect you to a fake Meta site to steal log-ins.""

He said that the fraudsters often target a personal Facebook page first, because all business accounts need to be linked to one.

""Your personal account will also have admin rights to your business account. The scammers go into your business account and transfer the admin rights to their own or to fake profiles.

""Then they go back to your personal account and disable it by posting inappropriate content like terror-related or pornography-related. That disables your account and makes it really hard to recover either that or your business account.""

The BBC has also learned of businesses losing access to their Facebook and Instagram accounts despite them not being hacked.

One small business which is part of franchise, told the BBC that they lost access to their account when another franchisee gained a blue-tick verification. As a result of that their account was flagged as a clone.

Meanwhile, others, such as digital marketer Chetha Senadeera, say that Meta has wrongly closed business accounts.

Last autumn he realised that a Facebook page he managed for a mobile bank had gone missing. ""It had just disappeared,"" he says.

""There was no notification to me or any of the team members. It was just gone. It was like it had been kidnapped, almost.""

The page was a crucial gateway to customers across Europe for Lithuania bank MyTU.

Mr Senadeera says that the customer support agents he spoke to at Meta, Facebook's owner, were baffled. He says they told him that they could see the page, but that it had been restricted, and that they couldn't unblock it.

Six months later, and the page remains locked.

Meta tells the BBC that the page had been removed for violating its scams policies, via a link on the page that was flagged by its systems as potentially harmful.

Mr Senadeera disputes that the firm has ever posted any harmful or misleading content. He says that Meta needs to do more, and move more quickly, to help firms get their Facebook and Instagram pages back, whether they have been a victim of fraud or not.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74zdm4kewlo
Why China curbing rare earth exports is a huge blow to the US ,"As the trade war continues to escalate, China has hit back at Trump by suspending exports of rare earth minerals.",Asia,"Asia, China, China-US relations",Ayeshea Perera,2025-04-17T00:15:59.527Z,2025-04-17T00:15:59.527Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4434/live/5449c230-1ab8-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4434/live/5449c230-1ab8-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1drqeev36qo,"As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.

But slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate.

China has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.

The move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.

This week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.  But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war?

""Rare earths"" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.

Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as ""rare"" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.

Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.

For instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.

Yttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.

""Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,"" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.

Rare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.

China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.

That means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.

Both the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting.

All rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.

""Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,"" says Mr Kruemmer.

But China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.

In a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: ""The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths"".

""Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,"" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.

""This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.""

In response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as ""heavy"" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector.

These are less common and are harder to process than ""light"" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.

From 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.

That is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of ""dual use products"".

According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.

A US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.

This means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.

Heavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.

A CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.

It adds that this comes as China ""expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States"".

""The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,"" said Mr Kroemmer.

And it's not only in the field of defence.

US manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.

""Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,"" said Dr Harper.

""Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,"" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies.

If such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require ""substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China"".

And it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals.

""President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,"" said the order.

""Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.""

The US has one operational rare earths mine, but it does not have the capacity to separate heavy rare earths and has to send its ore to China for processing.

There used to be US companies that manufactured rare earth magnets - until the 1980s, the US was in fact the largest producer of rare earths.

But these companies exited the market as China began to dominate in terms of scale and cost.

This is largely believed to be part of why US president Donald Trump is so keen to sign a minerals deal with Ukraine - it wants to reduce dependency on China.

Another place Trump has had his eye on is Greenland - which is endowed with the eighth largest reserves of rare earth elements.

Trump has repeatedly showed interest in taking control of the autonomous Danish dependent territory and has refused to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.

These might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.

""The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,"" said Dr Harper.

""Whether they will still prioritise collaboration with America remains to be seen in the turbulent policy environment of this new administration.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1drqeev36qo
Finland's bid to win Europe's start-up crown,"Helsinki wants to become a top European start-up hub, but can it challenge London and Stockholm?",N/A,"World of Business, International Business, Technology of Business",Maddy Savage,2025-04-14T23:01:05.120Z,2025-04-14T23:01:05.120Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6686/live/95a1d9d0-106c-11f0-b234-07dc7691c360.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6686/live/95a1d9d0-106c-11f0-b234-07dc7691c360.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28y8jj4lxo,"Yellow diggers are shoring up mounds of earth, as construction workers prepare to lay the foundations for what's set to become the largest start-up campus in Europe.

The project is an expansion of Maria 01, a co-working and event space for entrepreneurs and investors, as well as larger corporations that want to collaborate with tech start-ups.

Its existing facilities across the street already house around 240 start-ups. They are spread across six buildings that used to make up the city's first hospital, founded in the 19th Century and notorious in Helsinki for treating patients with the plague.

Now, the current 20,000 sq m site is a hub for companies developing innovative health technologies, alongside AI, cybersecurity, gaming and defence tech start-ups.

""The whole place is really based on community,"" says Maria 01's CEO Sarita Runeberg. ""We bring people together so they can network… and find different kinds of resources to grow their businesses.""

There are also office perks including a pool table, table football, running and ice bathing clubs, and in true Finnish-style, a sauna.

""We wouldn't be a proper start-up hub if we didn't have our own sauna here!"" laughs Ms Runeberg.

While co-working spaces for tech companies are well established across the Nordics, Maria 01 is the largest of its kind in the region.

It is run as a not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the city of Helsinki, which has invested more than €6m ($6.7m; £5.2m) in the hub since its launch in 2016.

Ms Runeberg believes it will become the biggest start-up campus in Europe following the completion of three new buildings by 2028, adding a 50,000 sqm floor area.

Later this year it is launching an accelerator programme designed to support and guide high-growth start-ups.



The hub's current and former members have already collectively raised over €1bn in funding.

This represents around 40% of all early stage funding raised annually by Finnish start-ups.

Ruben Byron is the Belgian co-founder of a start-up offering cloud services to AI developers.

He has already scaled his business from a handful of staff using the hub's hot desks to a team of around 40 working from private offices in the former hospital, as well as remotely.

""That has been a great experience, that we've kind of been able [to] be nurtured here in a way,"" he says.

Although not as mature – or well known globally – as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Finland has been steadily making a name for itself in the tech scene over the last two decades.

The small Nordic nation, which has a population of around 5.6 million, has spawned 12 unicorn businesses – firms worth a billion dollars or more – including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura, game developers Supercell, Rovio (the creators of the Angry Birds game), and food delivery platform Wolt.

Last year, Startup Blink, a global index mapping more than 100 countriesranked Finland's start-up ecosystemthe 7th best in western Europe, and 14th in the world.

The index cites factors including hubs like Maria 01, alongside high levels of state and university support, and Slush - a huge annual non-profit gathering for global start-ups and investors.

It also highlights Finland's transparent and open business culture.

""There is an authenticity with the Finns,"" says Jack Parker, a Helsinki-based founder originally from Newcastle upon Tyne, who runs a healthcare innovation start-up.

""Ego doesn't really play a part. So if I reach out to somebody, it's quite likely eight out of 10 times that they will respond.""

Finland's right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2023, is on a mission to push the country even further up global indices, stating in itsofficial government programmethat it wants the Nordic nation to become a leader in fostering a dynamic start-up and growth company ecosystem.

""It's not just about rankings,"" says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation.

In 2024 Business Finland aloneinvested €112m in start-ups, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year.

""The real goal is to create an environment where our ground-breaking start-ups can emerge and really tackle global challenges.""

The agency hopes this will help drive growth in the Finnish economy, which went into recession in 2023 and is currently making a sluggish recovery, with theBank of Finland forecastingan increase of less than 1% this year.

The country is also trying to attract more global talent by offering start-up permits for international founders who want to grow their businesses in Finland.

These entrepreneurs are eligible for a so-called soft-landing support package provided by Business Finland.

""They give you advice, support, sometimes grants to support the initiation phase,"" explains Lalin Keyvan, a Turkish-born entrepreneur at Maria 01 who says the scheme was one of the main reasons why she relocated to Helsinki.

Business Finland's marketing campaigns for would-be movers highlight social and lifestyle factors too: Finns tend to prioritise wellbeing, plus there's free education and subsidised healthcare and childcare.

""You don't really have to choose between building a high-growth company and enjoying life, because you can do both,"" says Ms Ilmari.

But whether all this is enough for Finland to compete with Europe's more established start-up hubs is up for debate.

Data suggests it still has a long way to go to catch up with neighbouring Sweden, long the Nordic darling of the European start-up scene.

It is home tomore than 40 unicorn businessesincluding Spotify, payments platform Klarna and game developer King.

In Startup Blink's ecosystem ranking Sweden ranks second in Europe after the UK, and top in the EU.

In the last decade it has attracted more than $29bn in funding compared to just over $8bn in Finland, according to the annualState of European Tech reportby investment company Atomico.

""I love Finland's bold approach,"" says Charlotte Ekelund, deputy CEO of Sting, a non-profit organisation that helps develop start-ups in Stockholm. However she believes Finland is still years behind Sweden in terms of pulling in capital and developing its ecosystem.

""We observe some of the things that the Finnish ecosystem is doing now, Sting was part of driving 10 or 15 years ago here - co-working spaces, [and] new organisations in the ecosystem that can support in different ways.""

Mikael Pentikainen, CEO of the Federation of Finnish Enterprises, says the country's government is currently losing support amongst entrepreneurs despite its pro-start-up and pro-business approach.

A recent survey for the organisationfound 41% of small and medium-sized business owners are satisfied with the coalition's actions, down from 54% in June.

One likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25.5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government saidthis was a ""difficult but necessary""move designed to stabilise public finances.

But Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland's start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders.

The Finnish government has also recently toughened up citizenship requirements, meaning foreign entrepreneurs now need to stay at least eight years instead of five in order to obtain a passport, and will soon also be required topass a test on Finnish societyand culture if they want to settle long-term.

Back at Maria 01, Mr Parker, the health company founder, says he's confident Finland's start-up ecosystem will continue to expand and attract international talent. But he warns it might lose some of the aspects that have so far made it an attractive option for entrepreneurs.

""The advantage of the ecosystem right now is this kind of 'small town, everybody knows each other' [feeling]. Scaling that up, there is the risk of actually losing that element of it.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28y8jj4lxo
Was China the reason this Caribbean nation faced higher Trump tariff?,"A Guyanese political commentator says Washington objects to Beijing's ""very strong foothold"" in the country.",Business,,Gemma Handy,2025-04-13T23:53:10.049Z,2025-04-14T05:39:46.333Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/68d8/live/f850bf40-160e-11f0-998c-6b1bac7d7605.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/68d8/live/f850bf40-160e-11f0-998c-6b1bac7d7605.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjeww5zq88no,"The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries.

Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports.

Following Trump's change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico.

But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place?

Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's ""very strong foothold"" in Guyana.

Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.

For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.

The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of ""consequences"" if it were to use force against Guyana.

But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. ""I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.

""The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president – and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.""

The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments. The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.

Last year it exported $3.13bn (£2.4bn) of crude oil to the US, accordingto United Nations figures.

Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.

This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.

And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.

Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.

So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.

With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.

In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China.

""Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,"" she explains. ""I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer.

""I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.""

Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item's cost.

Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs ""extremely worrisome"" and is urging citizens to ""buy smarter and buy local"".

Trump's tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic.

Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries.

""For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,"" he says.

""The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.""

As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: ""Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.""

The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.

""These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,"" Sir Ronald continues.

Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to$1.5m per docking.This idea was mooted by the White House in February.

Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.

Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US ""can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement"".

He adds: ""It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.""

Many Caribbean leaders feel the best strategy to thwart the fallout from tariffs is to negotiate as a bloc.

Mia Mottley, chair of the intergovernmental group Caricom, said the region was facing the most challenging of times since its 15 member states gained independence several decades ago.

""We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but… this trade war will mean higher prices for all of us,"" she said in a recent statement.

Ms Mottley added that it was vital to redouble efforts to ""invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing"".

""We must build our ties with Africa, Central and Latin America, and renew those ties with some of our older partners around the world, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and in Canada. We must not rely solely on one or two markets.""

Ms Mottley, who is also the prime minister of Barbados, is calling for Washington to ""work with"" the Caribbean to keep prices down.

She added: ""To the United States, I say this simply: 'We are not your enemy. We are your friends'.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjeww5zq88no
Do we need cocoa-free chocolate and is it nice?,Cocoa prices are soaring so new chocolate firms are looking at an alternative ingredient.,N/A,"World of Business, International Business, Diet & nutrition, Food, Technology of Business, Chocolate",Chris Baraniuk,2025-04-10T23:07:36.401Z,2025-04-10T23:07:36.401Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/24d2/live/7472e560-0bad-11f0-8e25-91624fd3b00c.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/24d2/live/7472e560-0bad-11f0-8e25-91624fd3b00c.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqj3z4g0e1o,"The first thing I notice is the lack of a strong aroma. There's no familiar, powerful waft of cocoa when opening this bag of sweets, the packet of biscuits, or the caramel-filled truffles.

And as I taste each one as part of my solemn commitment to inform the public, I don't get quite the same burst of chocolate flavour that you might expect from treats with that familiar, waxy, light brown chocolate-like coating. The thing is, this isn't chocolate. It's made with sunflower seeds. Or fava (also called broad) beans.

The selection before me is just a smattering of the non-cocoa containing alternatives to chocolate that are creeping into the European retail market right now. Their makers have spied an opportunity, partly because real chocolate prices are soaring.

""The average increase in price for chocolate was 9% over 2024,"" says Richard Caines, principal analyst in UK food and drink research at market research firm Mintel. ""In January just gone, it's shot up by 14%.""

That's the retail price of chocolate. The wholesale price of the key ingredient, cocoa – which is made from fermented, roasted and ground cacao beans – has increased by an astonishing 300% in 2024.

""I have been looking at this chocolate market for quite a few years now – I don't remember a big story like this on costs going up,"" adds Mr Caines.

A key reason for this increase is climate change-related weather impacts on cacao farms,particularly in West Africa.

Plus, some farmers in Ghana are turning away from cacao production in favour of illegal gold-mining, according to reports.

It means that there was a deficitof roughly 500,000 tonnes of cocoa in the global market last year.

Real chocolate could become a ""luxury"" item in the future says Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and chief executive of Italian firm Foreverland, which makes a cocoa powder alternative called Choruba.

The company opened its production facility in March, where staff process not cacao beans but carob husks.

Carob trees produce small, brown, banana-shaped pods containing seeds. It's possible to process the pods to create a cocoa-like powder. This chocolate alternative has a long history, however – and not a very happy one.

A New Yorker articleclaims a generation was ""traumatized"" by carob-based confectionary during the 1970s. It didn't taste as good as real chocolate, and it didn't melt in your mouth in the same way, apparently.

But Mr Sabatini insists that he and his colleagues have come up with a worthy product. He acknowledges that carob ""really doesn't taste like chocolate"" but adds that Foreverland's fermentation and roasting process removes some of the carob flavour to get it closer to cocoa.

Their carob-based dark chocolate alternative is sweeter and more caramel-like than real dark chocolate, he explains.

There could be health benefits to this. ""We can reduce drastically the sugar content,"" says Mr Sabatini. Carob is alsohigher in fibre and lower in fatthan cocoa.

German food manufacturer Planet A Foods has developed a different chocolate alternative. Sara Marquart, co-founder and chief technology officer, says her goal is not to replace chocolate but to help fill the gap in the market caused by volatility in cocoa availability and prices.

Unlike Foreverland, Planet A Foods have chosen sunflower seeds as the key ingredient in their cocoa powder alternative, ChoViva.

""We process sunflower seeds like cocoa beans,"" explains Dr Marquart. ""It's a highly abundant ingredient, there's millions and millions of tonnes on the market.""

ChoViva is now present in roughly 35 different retail products, mostly on the market in Germany and France – though it also appears in mini egg-shaped sweets sold by Aldi in the UK. The sweets are made with peanuts and have a chocolate-like coating containing ChoViva.

When I try them, the flavour is overwhelmingly dominated by the salty peanut at the egg's core. But the chocolatey texture of the coating is impressive. The same applies to ChoViva-covered biscuits made by the firm.

I note that the chocolate-like coating is rather thin and not overly flavourful. But again, the texture is pretty much what you'd expect from real chocolate, though not quite as melty.

The company's ChoViva-covered popcorn is probably the most chocolatey item I try – the popcorn doesn't usurp its coating.

Overall, there's nothing here that would perturb a consumer. Especially one unaware that these products don't actually contain chocolate.

A UK start-up also keen to compete in this space is Nukoko. Two of its founders previously ran a real chocolate business and teamed up with a food scientist to form their new venture.

""We saw first-hand the issues with the chocolate supply chain,"" says Ross Newton, co-founder. Like Foreverland and Planet A Foods, Nukoko has opted for a key ingredient that the firm can source and process locally – to reduce food miles and insulate against supply chain risks. But in Nukoko's case the raw material of choice is not carob or sunflower seeds but fava beans.

""There's around a million tonnes harvested in the UK every year,"" says Mr Newton.

It's early days for the company but he adds that he hopes to begin selling their cocoa powder alternative to food firms later this year.

Mr Newton says imitating the flavour of real chocolate is very hard but that, out of 25 crucial flavour compounds in real chocolate, his company's product manages to include 24 of them – though in some cases at slightly different concentrations.

The company sends me four caramel-filled truffles to try. The caramel totally dominates and the truffles are very sweet. But the chocolate alternative is as smooth and glossy as you'd expect, and very satisfying to chew.

""Anything new that comes out has got to meet equal taste expectations,"" says Mr Caines, noting how discerning consumers are when it comes to their favourite chocolate-containing products. Getting them to embrace alternatives devoid of cocoa will be no mean feat.

He adds that alternatives might fare best when used in bakery products – such as the chips in chocolate chip cookies: ""The chocolate is not so much the star of the show there so it might actually be more acceptable.""

Should chocolate alternatives meet with success, there is some risk that this could negatively impact cacao farmers, says Tonya Lander, a lecturer in biology at Oxford University.

""It's something that should be worked through with farmers or farmer collectives,"" she says. Cacao farmers are among thepoorest agricultural workersin the world.

Nukoko, Planet A Foods and Foreverland all say they don't aim to replace chocolate, rather, the goal is to fill the gap left by cocoa production shortfalls.

Dr Lander and colleagues have studied environmental factors that influence yield from cacao trees.

Poor pollination and high temperatures negatively affect how much cacao the trees produce, the researchers report in a studypublished in February.

By shading cacao trees on plantations, for example, it might be possible to improve harvests and potentially reduce the volatility of cocoa supplies. Such interventions, besides switching to cocoa alternatives, could help satisfy confectionary-obsessed consumers in the coming years.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqj3z4g0e1o
The plans to put data centres into orbit and on the moon,"Proponents say space-based data centres will be more secure, but sceptics say big hurdles remain.",Technology,"Companies, World of Business, International Business, SpaceX, Space debris, Space, The Moon, Data protection",Emma Woollacott,2025-04-09T23:04:05.882Z,2025-04-09T23:04:05.882Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9dc8/live/260a71f0-1485-11f0-9c12-3306e577b130.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9dc8/live/260a71f0-1485-11f0-9c12-3306e577b130.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjewvpkw7weo,"It sounds like something from a science fiction movie, but Stephen Eisele is confident that one day his company will open a data centre on the Moon.

""The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you're really offering unparalleled security,"" says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings.

Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to havesuccessfully testeda tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX.

Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.

Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them.

And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off.

Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth.

The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world.

As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to risebetween 19% and 22%by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey.

New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.

And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby.

Putting data centres in space – either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts.

Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground.

Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results.

The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results.

It determined that deploying data centres in space""could transform the European digital landscape"",and be ""more eco-friendly"".

Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers.

Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit.

Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible.

""But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,"" he says.

""The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037.""

However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.

""Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,"" he says. ""Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.

""Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.""

Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work well without gravity.

Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.

Dr Vicinanza adds: ""And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.

""A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.""

Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. ""We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,"" says Mr Scott.

Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.

Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.

""It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,"" he says. ""You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.""

The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups.

And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin.

""Under space law, that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state - it is an actual embassy in space,"" he says.

Lonestar already has customers lined up, including the state of Florida and the Isle of Man government.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjewvpkw7weo
The Canadians and Danes boycotting American products,"As anger grows over Trump's tariffs, apps and social media groups are helping people avoid US goods.",World,"Greenland, World of Business, International Business, Denmark, Trump tariffs, Trade war, Global trade, Canada",Anne Cassidy,2025-04-08T23:26:59.942Z,2025-04-08T23:26:59.942Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5eac/live/9b4ac040-0f90-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5eac/live/9b4ac040-0f90-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0el8ed21w9o,"Todd Brayman is no longer buying his favourite red wine, which is from California.

A veteran of the Canadian Armed Forces, he is one of a growing number of people in Canada, Europe, and other parts of the world, who are avoiding buying US products due to President Trump's tariffs and treatment of US allies.

""I have in my life served alongside American forces. It is just profoundly upsetting and disappointing to see where we are given the historical ties that our two countries have,"" says Mr Brayman, who lives in Nova Scotia.

""But I think right now it's time to stand up and be counted, and in my mind, that means buying local and supporting Canadian business.""

Together with his wife, Mr Brayman has replaced all the American products he used to buy, including his previous wine of choice, with Canadian alternatives.

""Luckett Phone Box Red wine, which is from right here in Nova Scotia, is great,"" he says.

Determining which products are Canadian isn't always easy however. ""Sometimes labelling can be misleading,"" adds Mr Brayman.

To help, he now uses an app on his phone that can scan a product's barcode and identify where it's from. If the product is identified as American, the app suggests Canadian alternatives.

The app, called Maple Scan, is one of numerous emerging in Canada to help people shop local. Others include Buy Canadian, Is This Canadian? and Shop Canadian.

Maple Scan's founder, Sasha Ivanov, says his app has had 100,000 downloads since it launched last month. He believes the momentum around buying Canadian is here to stay.

""Lots of Canadians have told me, 'I'm not going back'. It's important that we support local regardless,"" he says.

Canadians like Mr Brayman are boycotting American products in response to a raft of import tariffs introduced by Trump. These included tariffs of 25% on all foreign cars, steel and aluminium, and 25% tariffs on other Canadian and Mexican goods.

Meanwhile, other European Union exports will get tariffs of 20%, while the UK is facing 10%.

Trump says the tariffs will boost US manufacturing, raise tax revenue and reduce the US trade deficit. However, they have spooked global markets, which have fallen sharply over the past month.

Trump has even expressed a desire for Canada to join the US as its 51st state, something the Canadian government was quick to strongly reject.

Ottawa has also responded with C$60bn ($42bn; £32bn) in counter tariffs, as well as additional tariffs on the US auto sector.

And there has been a substantial drop in the number of Canadianstravelling to the US.

Groups dedicated to boycotting US goods have also emerged in European countries. Momentum behind the boycott is particularly strong in Denmark, whose territory of Greenland Trump has said he wants to acquire.

Denmark's largest grocery store operator, Salling Group, recently introduced a symbol, a black star, on pricing labels to denote European brands.

Bo Albertus, a school principal who lives in Skovlunde, a suburb of Copenhagen, says joining the boycott was his way of taking action. ""Statements that Trump made about wanting to buy Greenland, that was just too much for me,"" he says.

""I can't do anything about the American political system, but I can vote with my credit card.""

One of Mr Albertus's first moves was to cancel his subscriptions to US streaming services, including Netflix, Disney Plus and Apple TV. ""My 11-year-old daughter is a bit annoyed about it, but that's the way it is. She understands why I do it,"" he says.

Mr Albertus is the administrator for a Danish Facebook group dedicated to helping people boycott US goods. In the group, which has 90,000 members, people share recommendations for local alternatives to US goods, from shoes to lawnmowers.

Mr Albertus says: ""It's a movement that is quite a lot bigger than just our little country, so it all that adds up.""

Mette Heerulff Christiansen, the owner of a grocery shop in Copenhagen called Broders has stopped stocking American products, such as Cheetos crisps and Hershey's chocolate, in her store. She is substituting them with Danish or European products where possible.

Ms Christiansen is also swapping out products she uses at home. She's finding some easier to replace than others. ""Coca-Cola is easy to substitute with Jolly Cola, a Danish brand,"" she says. ""But technology, like Facebook, that's totally difficult to avoid.""

She believes the boycott movement in Denmark is helping people to channel their anger at Trump's policies and rhetoric. ""I think it's more for the Danish people to feel good that they are doing something,"" she says.

Douglas Irwin, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College in the US, who specializes in the history of US trade policy, believes the economic impact of the boycott may be limited. ""It is hard to judge how economically significant the consumer boycotts will be in terms of reducing trade with the United States,"" he says.

""In the past, boycotts have not lasted long and have not achieved much. It starts as a hostile reaction to some US action but tends to fade with time,"" he says.

For now though, the rising Buy Canadian sentiment in Canada is boosting sales for many local brands. The CEO of Canadian grocer Loblaw posted on LinkedIn that weekly sales of Canadian products were up by double digits.

Bianca Parsons, from Alberta in Canada, is behind an initiative to promote locally-made goods, called Made In Alberta, which she says has had a surge in interest since the tariffs were introduced. ""We're now getting over 20,000 hits [to the site] every two weeks.""

Ms Parsons, who is the executive director of the Alberta Food Processors Association, adds: ""I've had producers reach out to us and say: 'I'm selling out at stores that I would never sell out before, thank you so much'.""

Several Canadian provinces, including Ontario and Nova Scotia, have removed US-made alcoholic beverages from their liquor store shelves in response to tariffs, a move the boss of Jack Daniel's maker Brown-Forman has said is ""worse than tariffs"".

Among the American businesses feeling the impact is Caledonia Spirits, a distiller based in Vermont, near the Canadian border.  Ryan Christiansen, Caledonia's president and head distiller, says his business had an order on track for shipment to Quebec cancelled directly after tariffs were announced.

""My sense is that everyone's just being a little too aggressive and, unfortunately, I think America started that,"" says Mr Christiansen. ""I do understand that the action America took needed a counter reaction.

""If it were up to me, I'd be at the table trying to resolve this in a friendly way, and I'm hopeful that the leaders in America take that approach.""

Ethan Frisch, the co-founder of Burlap & Barrel, an American spice company based in New York, which also exports to Canada, says he's more concerned with the impact of the tariffs on his company's imports and rising inflation in the US than the consumer boycott.

He says: ""I think there's this assumption that, if you boycott an American company, it's going to have an impact on the economy and maybe change the situation. I think that assumption, unfortunately, is not accurate.

""The [US] economy is crashing all up by itself. Businesses like ours are struggling without boycotts.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0el8ed21w9o
A revolution is under way in India's trainer industry,India wants to boost the domestic trainer industry but will small domestic makers suffer?,Asia,"World of Business, International Business, Trainers, India, Technology of Business",Priti Gupta,2025-04-07T23:10:42.249Z,2025-04-08T01:51:32.165Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3100/live/90b206a0-04c5-11f0-8acd-09ec89d7a0aa.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3100/live/90b206a0-04c5-11f0-8acd-09ec89d7a0aa.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nplgm2kpo,"It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products.

Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.

So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.

Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.

The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: ""The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,"" he explains.

""There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,"" Mr Panaruna added.

The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.

To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.

Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.

""These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,"" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.

But many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands.

Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector.

Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market.

Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra.

""Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,"" he says.

""Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.""

So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?

""It's complicated,"" says Mr Sharma.

""I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.

""What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.""

Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector iswell-known formaking counterfeit shoes of big brands.

While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countrieshave long-complainedabout the losses caused.

Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class.

Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement.

Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.

""There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.

""And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.""

Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate.

It claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing.

""This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,"" says founder Utkarsh Gupta.

He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads.

""Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,"" he says.

Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. ""The shift to high value is now happening.""

""Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,"" he adds.

Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.

""The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.""

But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.

""The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly.

""But I don't think the small guys will disappear completely. The smart ones will find their niche.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nplgm2kpo
Halifax charity says children are being hurt by a lack of carpet,A Halifax charity says it has fitted carpets to more than 400 homes to help struggling families.,West Yorkshire,"Cost of Living , Halifax",Emma Glasbey,2025-04-24T05:12:37.838Z,2025-04-24T05:12:37.838Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a50b/live/ad8d17e0-1e99-11f0-9e5c-9579b04b24c6.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/a50b/live/ad8d17e0-1e99-11f0-9e5c-9579b04b24c6.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ypv2py18wo,"Children have been injured and patients left stuck in hospital because of a lack of carpet in their homes, a charity has said.

The Noah's Ark Centre, in Halifax, has fitted carpets in more than 400 homes since 2023 and said it had more than 70 people on its waiting list.

By law UK landlords only have to put flooring in kitchens and bathrooms, with campaign group End Furniture Poverty saying at least 1.2m homes have no carpet or flooring in their bedrooms and living areas.

Andrew Sykes, from the Noah's Ark Centre, said carpet was ""not just to make a home look pretty, it's to make a home safer and warmer"".

Mr Sykes said: ""We've had children hospitalised because of splinters in toes [and] I can think of at least three clients who were bed blocking in hospital because the hospitals wouldn't release them home because they didn't have carpets down.""

The vast majority of people living without flooring in all rooms - 760,000 - were in social housing, according to a survey of 5,500 people carried out by The National Centre for Social Research.

Often social landlords rip up flooring when a tenant moves on hygiene grounds - but it is not always replaced quickly.

When Chloe Ramsden and her five-year-old son moved into their home in Halifax there was only flooring in the kitchen and bathroom.

She said she had managed to save, with the help of her family, to buy carpet for the property but it had been damaged in a fire, leaving her with no flooring downstairs.

Ms Ramsden said her son, who has additional needs, had struggled with the bare floorboards.

""He doesn't like keeping things on his feet, so to just sit down in the living room and watch telly like a normal family causes a lot of emotional distress for him,"" she said.

""It's cold, it's sharp, it's hard. My heating bill has skyrocketed because it's freezing.

It's something very overlooked. People don't often think about flooring when moving house but actually it's quite a big thing for families.""

Noah's Ark Centre began providing carpet to those in need after teaming up with Leeds flooring provider Mercado.

John Clark, from Mercado, had contacted the charity after readinga BBC News article about social housing not providing new tenants with flooring.

""I read a heart breaking story about a mother who'd just moved into a house, and her young child got some splinters in his toes and was in quite a lot of pain,"" he said.

""We have discontinued lines and we struggle to recycle them at times [so] we decided to donate them to charity. It seemed the right thing to do.""

Noah's Ark has a waiting list of 70 people needing carpets or flooring.

""The cost of living crisis has been particularly brutal the last few years for those on the lowest incomes and people have to prioritise,"" Mr Sykes said.

""You have to prioritise feeding and clothing your children but a carpet is not just to make a home look pretty, it's to make a home safer and warmer.""

Ms Ramsden said she had been trying to save for new flooring but as a single mum, working part time, said she had found it difficult.

""I'll put £20 away and then my son will need new school shoes or we'll need food, milk, butter or whatever so we have to dip into that. It's just impossible.""

Noah's Ark has now fitted carpet in living room and flooring to her kitchen after she contacted the charity for help.

""I'm very excited, more so for my son. I can't wait to get him home from school because he knows it's happening,"" she said.

""The first thing he asked this morning was, 'I don't have to wear my shoes when I come from school do I?' and so he's very excited.""

Claire Donovan, End Furniture Poverty Director, added: ""Living without flooring has an impact on your comfort, the warmth of your home, and your mental wellbeing.

""It's also unsafe for families with young children, the elderly and those with disabilities to be living with concrete floors or rough floorboards, often with nails sticking out.

""We would urge all landlords to immediately stop the policy of asking tenants to remove flooring when they move out, instead assess it and if it is good enough quality, clean and leave in place for the next tenant.""

"How much money is the UK government borrowing, and does it matter?",The government gets most of its money from tax but also borrows when it wants to boost spending.,Business,,BBC News,2019-11-21T15:27:10.000Z,2025-04-23T10:47:30.000Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_news/1200/cpsprodpb/9B51/production/_133616793_gettyimages-129916784.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_news/1200/cpsprodpb/9B51/production/_133616793_gettyimages-129916784.jpg,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50504151,"The UK government generally spends more than it raises in tax.

To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest.

The government gets most of its income from taxes. For example, workers payincome tax and national insurance, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on profits.

It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes, and that sometimes happens.

But, if it can't, the government covers the gap by raising taxes, cutting spending or borrowing.

Higher taxes mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean companies pay less tax.

So, governments often decide to borrow to boost the economy. They also borrow to pay for big projects, like new railways and roads.

How the government raises and spends Â£1 trillion a year

The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds.

A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments.

UK government bonds - known as ""gilts"" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.

Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.

The government sells short and long-term gilts to allow it to borrow money over different time periods, with varying interest rates.

The amount the government borrows fluctuates from month to month.

For instance, it tends to borrow less in January, when many people pay a large chunk of their annual tax bill in one go.

So, it is more helpful to look across a whole year, or the year-to-date.

In the last full financial year, to March 2025,the government borrowed Â£151.9bn.,external

Borrowing in March alone stood at Â£16.4bn, which was Â£2.8bn more than a year earlier.

In the previous full financial year to March 2024, the government borrowed Â£131.2bn.

The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It is currently about Â£2.8 trillion - or Â£2,800,000,000,000.

That is roughly the same asthe value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year, known as the gross domestic product, or GDP.

The current level is more than double that seen from the 1980s through to the financial crisis of 2008.

The combination of the financial crash and the Covid pandemic pushed the UK's debt up.

But, in relation to the size of the economy, UK debt figures are still low compared with much of the last century. They are also less than the equivalent figures for some other leading economies.

The larger the national debt, the more interest the government pays.

That cost was not as great when interest rates were low during the 2010s, but became more noticeable after the Bank of England started raising interest rates in 2021.

The amount of interest the government pays on national debt also varies from month to month.

It was Â£4.3bn in March 2025. This was Â£1.3bn more than in March 2024, and is the highest March figure since monthly records began in 1997, though only Â£0.2bn above the previous record set in March 2023.

In early January 2025, interest rates for long-term borrowing rose to theirhighest levels this century, before falling back.

Chancellor Reeves vows action on growth amid rising debt costs

Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?

If the government has to set aside more cash for paying debts, it may mean it has less to spend on public services.

Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost. Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax in the long run.

The increase in long-term interest rates seen in January prompted some economists to warn that the government was ""on course"" to miss its own borrowing targets.

Labour decided to stick to a rule followed by the previous government that the total amount of money owed must have fallen as a proportion of the UK economy in five years' time.

In October's Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeveschanged the definition of debt that the government would use in the target to enable her to raise more money for investment.

It will now track a different, broader measure of debt called public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL). This includes, for example, the money the government gets from people repaying their student loans.

Downing Street said there was ""no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability"", and that ""meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable"".

The independentOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR)- which monitors the government's financial performance - will present its latest economic forecast to Parliament in late March.

It has previously warned that public debt could soar as the population ages and tax income falls.

In an ageing population, the proportion of people of working age drops, meaning the government takes less in tax while paying out more in pensions.

Free breakfast club trial at Sheffield school 'will make life easier',High Green Primary School in Sheffield is part of a government pilot providing free breakfast clubs.,South Yorkshire,"Sheffield, Cost of Living , School meals",Chloe Aslett & Vanessa Clarke,2025-04-22T20:45:13.312Z,2025-04-22T20:45:13.312Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/40b8/live/dbd78270-20ec-11f0-8451-0101bb35273b.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/40b8/live/dbd78270-20ec-11f0-8451-0101bb35273b.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly23epe989o,"Parents and teachers at a Sheffield primary school have welcomed the beginning of a scheme offering government-funded breakfast clubs.

High Green Primary School is one of 750 schools in England taking part in a pilot allowing parents to access half an hour of free childcare each morning.

The pilot willrun until July,after which the programme is expected to be rolled out nationally.

Karen Brennan, who previously paid for her daughter to attend the breakfast club two days each week, said: ""We couldn't afford for her to come every day before, but now she can.

""It means we are a lot freer as a family and she really enjoys it.""

The school said it previously could not make its breakfast club free for all pupils due to staffing and food costs.

Dan Emery, whose daughter attends the sessions, said: ""We have a little one too, so having the club will make life a lot easier when her mum goes back to work.

""I love having her at home, but it is helpful from a work perspective to be able to drop her off earlier - it's good for her development too and to give her time with her friends.""

Pupils at the school, on Wortley Road, High Green, are provided with toast, cereal, yogurt or fruit.

They can also make use of craft tables, jigsaws, books and play table football.

Dawn Aldridge, the school's business manager, said: ""The fact we have had children come to school hungry is a horrendous fact, it's shocking.

""Now, everybody's got a full tummy.""

She continued: ""They get to play with their friends and have a nice steady start to the morning - they are loving it.""

Ms Aldridge said she expected to see a reduction in pupil absences as the club ensured children are in school on time.

""They are learning about healthy eating and sticking to schedules – it's all good, and it's about that early intervention,"" she added.

Care homes in west 'at risk of bankruptcy' due to NI rises,Industry association Care and Support West says it is likely some small providers will struggle. ,Bristol,"Elderly people, Social care, Bristol, Cost of Living ",Matthew Hill,2025-04-22T05:10:56.429Z,2025-04-22T05:10:56.429Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f707/live/40ecdbc0-1ab6-11f0-ad3c-ad04864221b0.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f707/live/40ecdbc0-1ab6-11f0-ad3c-ad04864221b0.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4ney5dqpeo,"A leading care association in the west is warning some residential homes may go under due to rising costs such as National Insurance (NI) and the national living wage.

David Smallacombe, chief executive of not-for-profit organisation Care and Support West, says many care home operators will be forced to raise prices for vulnerable residents.

He is calling on the government to exempt social care providers from the NI hike, as it already has for the public sector and NHS.

A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it was working towards building a National Care Service ""that is fair and affordable for all"".

Care and Support West, which is funded by care home providers and also by four councils in the region, has calculated the tax rises will cost an extra £2,500 per staff member in care organisations.

Care home residents may entirely self-fund their place, or be partially or fully-funded by their local authority depending on the findings of a means test.

Mr Smallacombe said: ""Local authorities would, if they could try to meet that, find themselves in a position where they have not got the right amount of money coming in from central government to fit that.

""It's likely that some business will go out of business, which is a real worry.""

He added: ""It will make a big difference into how these organisation manage themselves - some will find either owners or managers doing care shifts at no charge. Sometimes they will have had to eat into the reserves.""

A resident of a care home in Patchway told the BBC of his shock at receiving a letter from the provider telling him he would face a 30% jump in fees due to rising costs, primarily NI.

The man, who did not wish to be named, was told his contribution to fees would rise from £460 to more than £600 per week.

He said: ""[Berkley Care Group] suggested the contribution from the council was to go up by 2% because they couldn't get any higher as the council is broke.

""But they put the cost up to the resident by 30% - I just blew a fuse. They can't do that, it's just profiteering.""

After telling Berkley he would take the matter to the BBC and his MP, the resident was told his contributions would only rise to £506 per week.

Berkeley's chief executive Laura Perry said this was an ""isolated case"" and that a ""miscalculation"" had occurred during the review process for the resident and had been immediately corrected.

She said the group had offered a full personal apology to the man.

But she added: ""Like all care providers up and down the country, we've been hit hard by the increase in employer National Insurance contributions.

""We've tried to shield our residents from these cost increases as much as possible and have ensured that our fee increase remained lower than many of our competitors.

""Nevertheless, careful fee adjustments for 646 of our residents have had to be made.""

A DHSC spokesperson said the government had allocated an additional £3.7bn to local authorities to help meet the cost of social care, and a further £502m to support them with NI rises.

""This government inherited an extremely damaged economy, NHS and social care sector, but we are turning this around through our Plan for Change,"" they said.

The spokesperson added: ""Baroness Louise Casey will be starting her independent commission into adult social care this month to build cross-party consensus for a National Care Service and a system fit for the future that is fair and affordable for all.""

Royal Mail: What made a billionaire want to buy this fading relic,"From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky who co-owns a football club - but why does he want it?",BBC InDepth,Royal Mail,Simon Jack,2025-04-13T23:27:04.322Z,2025-04-13T23:27:04.322Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/eeeb/live/60671aa0-16ca-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/eeeb/live/60671aa0-16ca-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4mm3kx0v2o,"From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by a Czech billionaire who co-owns a football club and is a major investor in a British supermarket - so, why would he want this ailing institution?

""A pair of scissors, one empty teapot and some hot water, please."" The slightly baffled staff at Claridge's scrambled to comply with Daniel Kretinsky's breakfast order as he sanitised and moisturised his hands.

The upscale hotel has been serving tea to the global elite for decades but Mr Kretinsky brought along his own packet of Chinese green tea, which he snipped open (hence the scissors) and poured into the empty pot.

He was tall, perfectly groomed, steely-eyed but unfalteringly polite and thoughtful. If you told anyone in the dining room he was a billionaire, they would have no problem believing it.

Known as the Czech Sphinx for his enigmatic style, Mr Kretinsky, who is 49, is worth £6bn according to the Sunday Times Rich List. He lives in plush mansions in Paris and London, was originally a lawyer and made his fortune in European energy markets.

Our meeting was at Claridge's in June 2024 - I was trying to convince him to give me an interview about his audacious attempt to buy a British institution that was once seen as a national treasure: Royal Mail.

His profile as a buyer was one that unions and ministers typically would be wary of because of his historic connections with Russia - his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe.

But six months on,his bid to buy Royal Mail'sparent company was cleared by the UK government after he agreed ""legally binding"" undertakings.

The government was awarded a so-called ""golden share"", requiring it to be notified of any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, headquarters location and tax residency. The deal was also blessed by unions.

Earlier this month, the owner of Royal Mail said that the takeover could be completed by the end of April as the deal cleared the final regulatory hurdles standing in the way.

But step back and Royal Mail seems a strange target for a globally mobile oil and gas billionaire investor to set his sights on. It begs the question why would anyone, let alone a successful international entrepreneur, want to buy this faded relic?

Royal Mail was founded by Henry VIII more than 500 years ago and still carries the royal cipher on its vans. It is part of the fabric of British life and many people still have a fond relationship with their 'postie', who walks down their path bringing their letters and parcels to their door.

But in recent years Royal Mail's crown has slipped. It is losing money and market share, has been fined for missing delivery targets and has made an enemy of its own workforce through a series of bitter strikes.

Royal Mail's letter business is in steep decline too. It has gone from a peak of 20 billion letters sent in 2004 to under seven billion sent last year.

In December 2024,it was fined £10.5mby the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail.

While the boom in e-commerce has seen the volume of parcels rise, Royal Mail's share of that more profitable business has been falling as new competitors like DPD, DHL, Amazon and Evri have eaten into its market share.

Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office in 2012 and privatised in 2013 at a value of £3.3bn. Its shares immediately rocketed by 38% on the first day of trading, leading to criticism - from the National Audit Office, among others - that it had been sold on the cheap.

At its peak in Covid-era May 2021, the company was worth more than £6bn but had slumped to just over £2bn when Mr Kretinsky launched his takeover bid last April.

He sealed the deal at £3.6bn- 63% higher than before he signalled his intent, but barely more than it was worth at privatisation over a decade ago.

""Royal Mail is a business that has historically found it difficult to grow revenues by more than costs,"" says Alex Paterson, an analyst at Peel Hunt stockbrokers. ""It has seen its parcels market share eroded by more dynamic competition that has been able to invest more in technology, and it has struggled with industrial relations to keep staff working towards a common goal.

""This is not a challenge to underestimate nor one that can be overcome quickly, but that requires considerable long-term investment in infrastructure, technology and staff.""

Part of the challenge, and one that puts Royal Mail at a disadvantage compared with its rivals, is that unlike them, Royal Mail has to meet a string of legal and regulatory obligations, says Hazel King, the editor of Parcel and Post Technology International.

Under what is called the universal service obligation (USO), Royal Mail is required by law to deliver letters six days a week and parcels five days a week to every address in the UK. So it cannot pick and choose which business it wants to do.

""Royal Mail must meet their universal service obligation while trying to compete with private firms who often cherry-pick the most profitable business,"" says Ms King.

Mr Kretinsky says he has a plan. His success in the energy sector allowed himto buy a 27.5% stakein Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS). And his company – EP Group – intends to build a pan-European conglomerate built on three pillars: energy, retail and logistics.

He sees IDS as the cornerstone of the logistics pillar, with a plan to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Deutsche Post DHL, DPD and Amazon.

The USO has been under review by Ofcom, with Royal Mail hoping that the regulator will reduce the requirement to deliver second-class letters from six days a week to every other weekday. That single move could save Royal Mail £300m a year – putting it back on a break-even footing.

Mr Kretinsky told me during our interview that he would honour the USO ""as long as I am alive"", but he is unsurprisingly very much in favour of changing its terms. He said he hopes that ""rational minds prevail"" when reforming a service that is unsustainable in its current form.

So far, the noises from Ofcom seem to be supportive. The regulator's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were ""real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future"".

Given letter numbers are falling, ""we have to think about what is economical"", she said, adding Ofcom would be publishing plans for the regulation of Royal Mail ""to make sure it is sustainable"".

While Royal Mail generally welcomed the proposed changes to the Universal Service Obligation, Royal Mail pushed back against proposed new delivery time and business customer requirements.

Royal Mail said last week that the level at which Ofcom is proposing to set the new delivery targets – 99.5% of First Class letters delivered within three days, and the same percentage of Second Class letters within five – is ""over specified and will add significant cost to the delivery of the Universal Service"".

It also expressed concerns that proposals to add a new category of regulation to ensure timely delivery for business users like direct mail companies ""goes against the wider government drive to reduce unnecessary regulation"".

But there are other factors that may have driven the sale. Some analysts have speculated that there is another jewel in the crown of IDS - and that Mr Kretinsky may really be after a different part of the business.

Along with Royal Mail, IDS also owns a European parcels business called GLS which it acquired in 1999 – long before Royal Mail was split off from the Post Office and privatised.

Last year GLS made a profit of £320m, compared to Royal Mail, which lost £348m as letter volumes continued to plunge and new competitors ate into its market share of the more profitable parcels business.

""GLS has been a profitable growth business, which has seen investment whereas Royal Mail has been a perpetual underperformer, as the board of parent company IDS has invested where it thinks it will see the best returns,"" says Mr Paterson.

Mr Kretinsky rejects suggestions from some quarters that he wants to break up the group and has committed to keeping it together for at least five years. Even beyond that, he says the plan is to grow the company rather than shrink it, so a disposal of GLS would be ""nonsensical"".

In fact, Mr Kretinsky says he hopes to bring the European parcel know-how at GLS to bear on Royal Mail's operations.

What the unions are hoping, and Kretinsky is promising, is that Royal Mail will see greater investment and over time begin to look a bit more like GLS and its European counterparts such as Deutche Post DHL.

Given all the challenges Royal Mail faces, there's an obvious question - why would a billionaire want to chance his arm on turning round something that others couldn't, while up against powerful competitors?

Well, if you believe as Kretinsky does - and he is surely right - that getting parcels to people is a profitable and growing industry, then buying Royal Mail and GLS gives you a way to become a big European player in logistics quickly.

Add to that a powerful and historic brand, a database with every single UK address and a frontline workforce that most of its customers are fond of and pleased to see when they walk down the path - then, despite the challenges, it begins to make sense.

Mr Kretinsky is convinced future growth lies in out-of-home (OOH) delivery. The parcel lockers found in supermarket car parks and elsewhere, operated by the likes of Amazon, Evri and UPS, have grown quickly across Europe.

Earlier this month it was reported that Sainsbury's would be the first supermarket to partner with Royal Mail and install parcel lockers at supermarkets. Some are already operating at several stores including ones in Clapham, Kidderminster and Chislehurst.

Royal Mail has also trialled a new postbox that can take small parcels. Customers procure a barcode from an app, then at the postbox they scan the barcode and drop the parcel into a drawer - this is all powered by solar panels on the box.

Emma Gilthorpe, Royal Mail chief executive, called it an ""historic change"" to give postboxes ""a new lease of life"".

All of this boils down to the same thing: convenience. It means customers don't have to wait at home for a delivery - the sender or parcel business emails or texts a code to unlock the locker. For the business it's more efficient, allowing couriers to deliver lots of parcels to one place - meaning fewer miles on the road and less time.

""If they can grow the parcels business and claw back market share, there is every chance that they can add new jobs that could offset the reduction in jobs in the declining letters business,"" says Mr Paterson.

""There is a significant long-term opportunity to run Royal Mail more successfully with regulatory changes to the USO and greater investment in technology and out-of-home deliveries.""

But Royal Mail still has a lot of catching up to do with its competitors. It currently has 1,500 lockers in the UK and aims to grow this figure to at least 20,000 over time. By contrast, Amazon already has 5,000 lockers across the UK and InPost has 7,500 across the UK.

That Mr Kretinsky has pulled off the takeover is no easy feat. Royal Mail is, after all, considered vital national infrastructure and as such the deal required review under national security laws.

Then there is the fact that his companies own a gas pipeline that has transported Russian gas to Europe – paid for and approved by EU member states. The small amount that was transported was reduced to zero at the end of 2024 when Ukraine refused to renew permission for any gas to flow across its borders.

Speaking in front of MPs in November, UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds referred to Mr Kretinsky as a ""legitimate business figure"" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company two years ago.

Getting the unions on board seemed even more of a challenge and the Communication Workers Union was wary of Mr Kretinsky. ""The CWU believes Royal Mail should be in public hands,"" Dave Ward, the CWU's general secretary, told the BBC in June. ""We know there are legitimate concerns about Royal Mail Group being owned by a foreign private equity investor.""

But during negotiations, union representatives secured a series of time-limited commitments from him, including guarantees that he will protect Royal Mail's pension surplus, that there will be no compulsory redundancies for two years, no sell-off or break-up of any operational part of the existing company and no outsourcing of grades represented by the CWU.

Mr Kretinsky also agreed to restrictions on moving dividends out of Royal Mail Group and to respect agreements with and recognition of the CWU. He said he would keep the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years.

Union bosses told me that a life under Mr Kretinsky ""couldn't be any worse than what we have had for the last 10 years"".

So, as Mr Kretinsky looks certain to pull off the sale, what will customers notice?

The frequency of second-class deliveries may be reduced after the Ofcom review. We will see new Royal Mail lockers appearing in our neighbourhoods. And the price of first-class mail may go up: second-class stamps are regulated by Ofcom, while first-class ones are not.

The monarch's head will still be on those stamps, but there is a new king of our mail system. And his name is Daniel Kretinsky.

But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out.

The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.

What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.

And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.

Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.

Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.

The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it ""great"" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.

On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.

There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.

Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.

Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.

But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.

It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called ""reciprocal"" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.

The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first,complicated looking equationrevealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.

In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. ""These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers… The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.""

This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition ""cheating"" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.

This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffingrarely visited islands only inhabited by penguinsmatter. It reveals the actual method.

The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.

While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.

There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.

The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (£216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.

Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.

There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that ""rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things"".

That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.

For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term ""China shock"".

In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, andso transforming the global economy.

Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of ""comparative advantage"". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.

Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.

Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this ""China shock"" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.

The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.

Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.

Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.

So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president'sclear message to foreign companiesis to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.

But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having ""raped and pillaged"" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.

The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.

The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.

Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.

The world's consumers have choices.

It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.

Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.

Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience ofTesla's sale slumpand Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.

These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.

The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.

In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.

This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.

Perhaps there is some substance to the theory thatthe real objective hereis to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.

For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.

"Laura Kuenssberg: After Trump tariffs, Sir Keir Starmer is to slow down and go faster","What's happening in Whitehall to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?",BBC InDepth,"UK trade tariffs, Keir Starmer, Trump tariffs, Trade war, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, UK economy, Donald Trump",Laura Kuenssberg,2025-04-05T12:25:17.224Z,2025-04-05T12:25:17.224Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1874/live/93c751c0-114e-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1874/live/93c751c0-114e-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm257qmvg25o,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer watched in his flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw it in her study. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, accompanied by staff and pizza, took in President Donald Trump's big tariffs reveal on Wednesday from his office in Old Admiralty Arch, from where the British Navy was directed to protect and control trade on the high seas in days gone by.

Ministers can only dream of having that kind of power now, as the UK watches on in growing horror at the bust-up between the US and China.

""Sometimes people don't realise they are living through a moment of history,"" a cabinet minister notes, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping square up to each other, and stock markets plunge. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations – including the UK – for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.

So what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?

The PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.

Trump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair'schummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.

Those talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (""space to talk about it"", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (""not happening"", says a government source).

But as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the ""ball is in their court"", said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump's new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK.

""We're expecting to hear from them any moment,"" one of those involved hopes. The risk, in the visible turmoil, is that any economic agreement could become a case of: don't call us, we'll call you. We'll be asking Darren Jones, the Treasury Minister, about it when he join us in the studio tomorrow.

If a deal is done, however, do not expect an all-singing all-dancing arrangement. Instead, ""it would be a basic agreement on principles – rather than a super detailed trade agreement"", says a government source, contrasting these ""quick and dirty"" moves to long-running negotiations with India (""we're on our 15th chapter with them!"").

Uncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is ""not sitting here waiting for it – it's not the basket where all our eggs are"".

For weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. A secret cabinet committee was considering how the UK might react if Trump's tariffs materialised.

But now they are here, the actual response is… not to respond, and to spend four weeks asking businesses if they would like the government to respond later on. That is not just Whitehall dither: at this stage, there seems to be almost zero appetite among ministers to join in with the rounds of tariffs between the US, China, and perhaps the EU in coming days.

One Whitehall figure working with business says ""there has not been a single voice in business, big or small, saying this is the wrong strategy"".

Ministers' approach to get businesses on board, like when Sir Keir invited dozens of big wigs to No 10 the morning after Trump's tariff announcement, is in part because of the anger when the government increased National Insurance contributions. ""The really calm reaction,"" one source says, ""is because we got people into the headspace where tariffs were going to happen – one of the businesses said they were being borderline stalked, we've been trying to persuade business to trust the process.""

The government is in no rush, and has no enthusiasm to introduce its own new tariffs, and for now at least, demands on them to do so are muted. According to a minister: ""Most people have considerable numbers of jobs in their constituencies on the line – even in cabinet there might have been some question marks but there weren't this week.""

And they joke that the Lib Dems, who are calling for tariffs in retaliation, ""keep demanding a trade war but I don't think they'll lead the nation"". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who also does not want extra tariffs, will be on tomorrow's show too.

But just as the government is going slow on hitting back, they are cracking heads to crack on with their existing plans faster.

This isn't all about Trump. I understand the chancellor is looking at whether any of the money announced in the government's vital Spending Review can be brought forward from June. If government departments are able to finalise their deals, can that be sorted and made public as soon as possible?

There are discussions too about whether it's possible to speed up the long waited-for Industrial Strategy – a plan to get investment into the UK pencilled in for June, but could it be brought forward? A decision hasn't been made but the prime minister is again, his team indicate, trying to use the jeopardy around the world as an impetus to push the government machine harder. ""We have to run quickly towards this,"" a government source says – and the chancellor is looking at it this weekend.

You might feel, haven't I heard this before? You'd be right. Since the start of the year, the prime minister and the chancellor have both repeatedly said the government has to go faster, work harder. So why after years in opposition weren't Starmer's team ready to go with all of these changes when they got into office? For a government that promised to be radical, its plans have not always been forthcoming.

You may not fancy the kind of radicalism we're seeing out of the White House, but radical it certainly is. To compete, the UK may need to be that too.

It is ludicrous to imagine the PM is ""very happy"" that the UK has been hit with tariffs as Trump suggested – ""artistic licence"", a government source remarked. No British action can completely insulate our economy from disruption abroad. But the government's own actions do matter, and this could be a defining moment.

While there's been no lack of trying to soften the blows for the UK, the government's hopes have been dashed already. First, ministers believed the UK could escape tariffs, then they said they were prepared in case, then disappointed when they arrived.

As Sir Keir spends another weekend on the phone, and his officials wait for their phone to ring, the government doesn't know what it will be able to say next.

I thought the free market was forever - then Trump came along,Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge,BBC InDepth,Economics,David Dimbleby ,2025-03-28T00:00:13.912Z,2025-03-28T00:00:13.912Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8498/live/7f501470-0b27-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/8498/live/7f501470-0b27-11f0-ba12-8d27eb561761.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gey6pvddo,"I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.

And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.

This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.

There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.

There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.

That idea was the free market.

This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.

If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.

What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.

US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.

It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?

So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.

But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.

I was six when the war ended. There was rationing – coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.

With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.

But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.

""We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,"" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.

However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.

That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.

Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.

Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.

The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.

In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.

And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.

In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of £60bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.

Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.

And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.

There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.

At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.

James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.

But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.

""You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.

""You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.""

Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.

And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.

Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?

Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.

Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.

Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.

The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.

In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.

What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.

Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.

Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.

President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.

But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.

There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.

Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.

The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.

That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.

Rachel Reeves is feeling the heat ahead of her Spring Statement,The Chancellor hints at a more guarded approach amid global uncertainty - and issues a warning ahead of her announcements.,BBC InDepth,"Rachel Reeves, Keir Starmer, Chancellor's Spring Statement, UK economy, Donald Trump, Labour Party, Laura Kuenssberg",Laura Kuenssberg,2025-03-22T06:27:21.751Z,2025-03-22T06:27:21.751Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c78c/live/ad772340-064d-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c78c/live/ad772340-064d-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0egy79qx93o,"In a discussion ahead of next week's statement, the chancellor hints at a more guarded approach amid global uncertainty - and issues a warning.

A thick skin is a must for our top politicians. There's rolling news, nonstop social media and public scepticism. Add in the battle with the country's deep and persistent problems. And these days the problems include constant and very real global turmoil.

The questions for the politicians are profound and that's something the Chancellor Rachel Reeves gets.

""I recognise that with the privilege of doing a job like the one I'm doing today also comes a great deal of scrutiny. I absolutely believe that every policy that I announce, every pound of public money, of taxpayers money that I spend, and every pound that I take from people in terms of taxes is properly scrutinised. That's part of the job,"" she tells me.

But next comes an admission, from this professionally tough politician, described to me by one of her colleagues once as 'hard as nails', that when things get personal, she doesn't like it.

""One of the things I think that I find hard, even with the thicker skin I guess I must have developed over these last 14 or so years, is some of the personal criticism because that's not the sort of politics that I do,"" she tells me.

As admissions go it's modest and general in nature.

But read in the context of someone who is taking decisions with big consequences for many, many people's lives while at the same time being someone who has faced awkward questions about her own job history and CV, this may be Reeves' way of telling us that she's feeling the heat.

Perhaps the admission came because this was an unusual conversation. We were not under the studio lights but instead in the Treasury itself for the making of a BBC documentary, The Making of a Chancellor, trying to understand the thinking behind the big decisions Reeves takes.

Our conversation came a couple of hours after the Labour government had revealed  billions of pounds of welfare cuts, most notably stricter tests for personal independence payments (Pips). The aim is to save £5bn by 2030.

But there is real anxiety in her party about what she and Sir Keir Starmer are doing.

And when I ask the chancellor about these cuts, she prefers to speak about Labour's broader vision for the economy, instead giving a warning - that this Labour government won't be able to do what its members and backers might have expected and hand out handsome increases to government departments like its predecessor.

""There's growth, real growth every year actually, in public spending, but not at the levels that we were able to deliver under the last Labour government when the economy was growing much more strongly,"" she tells me.

""We've got to ramp it up and continue to ensure that we're doing everything we can to lift living standards and in the end that is through growing the economy. We can't tax and spend our way to higher living standards and better public services. That's not available in the world we live in today.""

The signalling for the Spring Statement is that there will be no more tax rises and no more increases in government spending, instead a scalpel is set to be taken to some departments. This is the opposite of what she did in the autumn and the opposite of what you'd assume Labour chancellors do.

This more guarded approach is in part a response to the uncertainty created by the Trump administration - nobody knows quite what is around the corner.

But she has been taking inspiration from across the Atlantic for many years.

One of Reeves' first jobs was working as an economist at the British Embassy in Washington from 2002 to 2003. That era defined her early thinking and she's still gazing to America for inspiration – Reeves' first call as chancellor was to Janet Yellen, then her counterpart in DC as treasury secretary in president Joe Biden's administration.

I ask Yellen for her advice to Reeves now, nearly a year on. She says to keep doing the difficult things: ""I think she [Reeves] should, you know, stick with the course that she set out and move things, move things forward with, you know, as much speed and commitment as she possibly can.""

But there is tension in Reeves' approach. Labour is increasing tax, but squeezing some spending. Ministers are rolling back some rules and regulations, but giving workers more rights at work. In effect they are putting the brakes and the accelerator on at the same time.

She is aware there is no one thing she can do to suddenly create prosperity. And so how long can people be expected to wait for the change they've been promised?

Communication is key according to Yellen: ""Before you get improvements that are noticeable to voters in infrastructure and job creation, it does take time and so you don't get the immediate payoff.

""And so communication, I think, is very important to make the population understand that this is an approach that requires some patience to see the payoff. But truly, it's the only way, over the medium term, to boost living standards in major economies.""

Reeves is asking voters to believe that some of the tough choices she is making can be explained, at least in part, by the fact that the world around her has changed in a way she hadn't anticipated when her party was beginning to prepare its new offer to the public in the aftermath of Labour's 2019 election defeat.

First, a massive £28bn borrowing that had been earmarked to spend on green projects was binned, a necessary response to the economic turmoil under Liz Truss according to Labour - not a view shared by opponents who never thought Labour's policy credible.

Whereas once she said she would be the first green chancellor, now Reeves is signing off airport expansion at Heathrow, proposing to get rid of regulations, and ousting the regulator at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).

Labour argues the country's economic books were worse than expected when they took power. And much more recently, uncertainty over Donald Trump's willingness to support Ukraine and Nato more widely has seen the UK commit more money to defence.

""The world has changed, [we] can see it before our eyes, in a whole number of respects,"" Reeves tells me.

""[We are seeing] greater instability and insecurity in the world, Europe having to take on a bigger role in our continent for our own defence.""

But to some, Reeves' willingness to change course raises the question as to what kind of Labour politician she is.

The cuts to welfare are at the heart of this. At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir declared that welfare reform was a ""moral issue"", while the veteran left-wing MP Diane Abbott argued there was ""nothing moral about cutting the benefits of millions of people"".

Reeves sat out much of Labour's doomed period with Jeremy Corbyn as leader. She was always serious, watchful, with an eye on her party's and her own future.

When she became shadow chancellor she put enormous efforts into schmoozing the city, even if she did once confess she'd instruct her team to sweep up any left over pastries at the end of their business breakfasts.

Reeves sees herself as a pragmatic politician, not an ideologue, whether that means increasing taxes in her first budget to fund public services or conversely cutting benefits in this week's statement.

Deborah Mattinson was Sir Keir's director of strategy up until the election. She argues Reeves is canny and it is her values that make her Labour.

""She is very, very savvy. She's good at looking around corners.

""It's a cliche to say she's a chess player, but actually it is true that she's not somebody who deals with the problem that's right in front of her and leaves it there. She's somebody who is able to look several moves ahead and always has that slightly longer-term focus.""

Reeves would tell you her politics were made at home, her values that of the south London girl who worked hard and made it to the Bank of England, her economics crafted by study and experience but also the requirements of getting elected – remember she chose politics not economics after all.

That, according to Deborah Mattison is key. The decisions Reeves takes are based squarely on ensuring Labour is viewed as economically credible. The argument is that if it isn't seen as sufficiently credible it won't be in power and then nothing else really matters.

""You can't win an election if you're not trusted to run the economy. And Labour has a historical problem that goes back a very, very long way,"" she tells me.

""After [the election defeat] in 2010, that all dissipated… [and] the Corbyn years, really, really were problematic. So that's the situation that she inherited and we were no further forward by the time she was appointed shadow chancellor.

""By the time we went into the election, she had a double-digit lead over her Tory opposite number. That is one hell of an achievement.""

Like her predecessors in New Labour, Reeves takes the view that the public is less interested in Labour's economic ideology and more interested in delivering economic prosperity. (Her opponents on the left of the party would argue a clear ideological stance and economic success are not mutually exclusive).

However there is one clear division between Reeves and Gordon Brown, chancellor between 1997-2007. Whereas Brown made little secret of his craving to be prime minister, Reeves says she doesn't have the same goal.

""I honestly have no desire whatsoever to do that job. That's not always the answer you might get from chancellor of the exchequer, but in my case, it's absolutely true. The job I've always wanted is this one.

""And I'm very, very lucky because there aren't many people in politics or in other walks of life that manage to do the job that they've always dreamed of perhaps. And for me, I'm doing that today in this job.""

But make no mistake, next week's Spring Statement is the stuff of nightmares for a Labour chancellor. Her party will hate the cuts to welfare.

And at the same time, borrowing and unemployment are ticking up and there is no sign of the economy budging, even though getting it to grow is Labour's number one mission.

Rachel Reeves is the architect and face of her government's economic plans. If she is indeed feeling the heat, perhaps it's little surprise.

Ofcom finalises rules for tech firms to protect children online,Websites will have to instate age checks and tighten up algorithm recommendations for young users. ,Technology,"Online Safety Bill, Social media, Ofcom",Hafsa Khalil & Imran Rahman-Jones,2025-04-24T07:00:22.669Z,2025-04-24T11:20:59.780Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1ac0/live/9dd349a0-20d8-11f0-b0e5-d9ee068af7b4.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1ac0/live/9dd349a0-20d8-11f0-b0e5-d9ee068af7b4.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yljn2vkn1o,"Websites will have to change the algorithms that recommend content to young people and introduce beefed-up age checks or face big fines, the UK media regulator has confirmed.

Ofcom says its ""Children's Codes"" - the final versions of which have now been published - will offer ""transformational new protections"".

Platforms which host pornography, or offer content which encourages self-harm, suicide or eating disorders are among those which must take more robust action to prevent children accessing their content.

Ofcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes said it was a ""gamechanger"" but critics say the restrictions do not go far enough and were ""a bitter pill to swallow"".

Ian Russell, chairman of the Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up in memory of his daughter - who took her own life aged 14 - said he was ""dismayed by the lack of ambition"" in the codes.

But Dame Melanie told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that age checks were a first step as ""unless you know where children are, you can't give them a different experience to adults.

""There is never anything on the internet or in real life that is fool proof… [but] this represents a gamechanger.""

She admitted that while she was ""under no illusions"" that some companies ""simply either don't get it or don't want to"", but emphasised the Codes had legal force.

""If they want to serve the British public and if they want the privilege in particular in offering their services to under 18s, then they are going to need to change the way those services operate.""

Prof Victoria Baines, a former safety officer at Facebook told the BBC it is ""a step in the right direction"".

Talking to the Today Programme, she said: ""Big tech companies are really getting to grips with it , so they are putting money behind it, and more importantly they're putting people behind it.""

Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said key to the rules was tackling the algorithms which decide what children get shown online.

""The vast majority of kids do not go searching for this material, it just lands in their feeds,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.

Kyle toldThe Telegraphhe was separately looking into a social media curfew for under-16s, but would not ""act on something that will have a profound impact on every single child in the country without making sure that the evidence supports it"".

Thenew rulesfor platforms are subject to parliamentary approval under the Online Safety Act.

The regulator says they contain more than 40 practical measures tech firms must take, including:

If companies fail to abide by the regulations, Ofcom said it has ""the power to impose fines and - in very serious cases - apply for a court order to prevent the site or app from being available in the UK.""

Children's charity the NSPCC broadly welcomed the Codes, calling them ""a pivotal moment for children's safety online.""

But they called for Ofcom to go further, especially when it came to private messaging apps which are often encrypted - meaning platforms cannot see what is being sent.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yljn2vkn1o
Trump crypto soars as US president offers dinner to top holders,The meme coin's website says its 220 top investors will be invited to a gala event with the president.,Business,"International Business, Donald Trump, Cryptocurrency",João da Silva,2025-04-24T03:55:07.690Z,2025-04-24T04:55:23.210Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4fe0/live/a7382ac0-20b9-11f0-8795-4f2eeb44dbb2.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4fe0/live/a7382ac0-20b9-11f0-8795-4f2eeb44dbb2.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8g2kpzx0go,"The price of Donald Trump's cryptocurrency has soared after the US president promised to host two special events for its top investors.

The website for the $Trump meme coin says its 220 biggest holders will be invited to a private gala dinner with the president on 22 May, describing it as the ""most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world.""

According to crypto trading platform Coinbase, $Trump jumped by more than 70% after the announcement. But it remains well below the record high of more than $74 (£42.40) reached shortly after its launch in January.

The digital currency is one of several crypto-related ventures launched by businesses linked to Trump, who has called himself the ""crypto president"".

As well as the gala dinner, which will be held at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington DC, there will be ""an ultra-exclusive private VIP reception with the President"" for the top 25 coin holders, the coin's website said.

Trump tokens in circulation are currently worth a total of around $2.5bn. They were first released just days before his inauguration on 20 January.

The move wascriticised by several people in the crypto industry, with some calling it ""a stunt"".

First ladyMelania Trump also launched a cryptocurrencyon the eve of the inauguration.

Meme coins are often used by speculators to make money or to allow fans to show support to a celebrity or moment in internet culture.

Shortly after returning to the White House this year, Trump signed an executive order to create a presidential working group tasked with proposing new crypto laws and regulations.

He has also signed an order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve as well as a Digital Asset Stockpile, which will include other digital currencies.

Those funds will be stocked with coins forfeited to the federal government as part of criminal or civil proceedings.

This week, Trump's media companyannouncedplans to launch exchange traded-funds (ETFs).

The financial products to be launched by Trump Media & Technology Group, owner of the Truth Social platform, and its partners will include digital assets as well as stocks with a ""Made in America focus"".

WhatsApp defends 'optional' AI tool that cannot be turned off,"While Meta says the AI chatbot is a ""good thing"", some users have shared their frustrations.",Technology,"WhatsApp, Artificial intelligence, Meta, Facebook, Technology",Graham Fraser,2025-04-23T14:26:00.265Z,2025-04-23T14:26:00.265Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/821f/live/010a6e10-1f79-11f0-bdfc-33d5f1a51c32.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/821f/live/010a6e10-1f79-11f0-bdfc-33d5f1a51c32.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7vzw78gz9o,"WhatsApp says its new AI feature embedded in the messaging service is ""entirely optional"" - despite the fact it cannot be removed from the app.

The Meta AI logo is an ever-present blue circle with pink and green splashes in the bottom right of your Chats screen.

Interacting with it opens a chatbot designed to answer your questions, but it has drawn attention and frustration from users who cannot remove it from the app.

It follows Microsoft's Recall feature, which was an always-on tool - before the firm faced a backlash anddecided to allow people to disable it.

""We think giving people these options is a good thing and we're always listening to feedback from our users,"" WhatsApp told the BBC.

The company likens the feature to other permanent options in the app like 'channels' and 'status'.

It comes the same week Meta announced an update to its teen accounts feature on Instagram.

The firm revealedit was testing AI technologyin the US designed to find accounts belonging to teenagers who have lied about their age on the platform.

If you can't see it, you may not be able to use it yet.

Meta says the feature is only being rolled out to some countries at the moment and advises it ""might not be available to you yet, even if other users in your country have access"".

As well as the blue circle, there is a search bar at the top inviting users to 'Ask Meta AI or Search'.

This is also a feature on Facebook Messenger and Instagram, with both platforms owned by Meta.

Its AI chatbot is powered by Llama 4, one of the large language models operated by Meta.

Before you ask it anything, there is a long message from Meta explaining what Meta AI is - stating it is ""optional"".

On its website,WhatsApp saysMeta AI ""can answer your questions, teach you something, or help come up with new ideas"".

I tried out the feature by asking the AI what the weather was like in Glasgow, and it responded in seconds with a detailed report on temperature, the chance of rain, wind and humidity.

It also gave me two links for further information, but this is where it ran into problems.

One of the links was relevant, but the other tried to give me additional weather details for Charing Cross - not the location in Glasgow, but the railway station in London.

So far in Europe people aren't very pleased, with users on X, Bluesky, and Reddit outlining their frustrations - and Guardian columnist Polly Hudson was among thoseventing their anger at not being able to turn it off.

Dr Kris Shrishak, an adviser on AI and privacy, was also highly critical, and accused Meta of ""exploiting its existing market"" and ""using people as test subjects for AI"".

""No one should be forced to use AI,"" he told the BBC.

""Its AI models are a privacy violation by design - Meta, through web scraping, has used personal data of people and pirated books in training them.

""Now that the legality of their approach has been challenged in courts, Meta is looking for other sources to collect data from people, and this feature could be one such source.""

An investigation byThe Atlanticrevealed Meta may have accessed millions of pirated books and research papers through LibGen - Library Genesis - to train its Llama AI.

Author groups across the UK and around the world are organising campaigns to encourage governments to intervene, andMeta is currently defending a court case brought by multiple authors over the use of their work.

A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment on The Atlantic investigation.

When you first use Meta AI in WhatsApp, it states the chatbot ""can only read messages people share with it"".

""Meta can't read any other messages in your personal chats, as your personal messages remain end to end encrypted,"" it says.

Meanwhile the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC it would ""continue to monitor the adoption of Meta AI's technology and use of personal data within WhatsApp"".

""Personal information fuels much of AI innovation so people need to trust that organisations are using their information responsibly,"" it said.

""Organisations who want to use people's personal details to train or use generative AI models need to comply with all their data protection obligations, and take the necessary extra steps when it comes to processing the data of children.""

Dr Shrishak says users should be wary.

""When you send messages to your friend, end to end encryption will not be affected,"" he said.

""Every time you use this feature and communicate with Meta AI, you need to remember that one of the ends is Meta, not your friend.""

The tech giant also highlights that you should only share material which you know could be used by others.

""Don't share information, including sensitive topics, about others or yourself that you don't want the AI to retain and use,"" it says.

EU hits Apple and Meta with €700m of fines,"The tech giants have reacted with fury, accusing the EU of unfairly pursuing US companies.",Technology,"Social media, European Commission, Meta, Facebook, Apple, European Union",Imran Rahman-Jones,2025-04-23T10:59:44.793Z,2025-04-23T15:46:36.696Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10b2/live/30e26320-202f-11f0-8ff6-2f179a342bec.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/10b2/live/30e26320-202f-11f0-8ff6-2f179a342bec.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm248vzg9jwo,"The European Union has ordered Apple and Meta to pay a combined €700m (£599m) in the first fines it has issued under legislation intended to curb the power of big tech.

It has issued a €500m (£428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined €200m (£171m) over how much choice users had to consent to data collection.

""We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,"" Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.

The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of ""attempting to handicap successful American businesses"" and Apple saying it was being ""unfairly targeted"" and forced to ""give away our technology for free.""

The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump.

The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of ""taking advantage"" of America.

EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were ""completely separate"", telling the BBC: ""This is about enforcement, it's not about trade negotiations.""

The White House has been contacted for comment.

The European Commission - the EU's executive - started both investigationslast yearunder a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA).

The case against Apple wasover its App Store.

The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this.

Meanwhile, Meta's fine was over the choices it offered on data collection.

Meta introduced a ""consent or pay"" model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, orpaying a monthly subscription.

The Commission says this model did not allow users to freely consent to how their data was used.

In November, Meta introduced another option, which the Commission says ""allegedly uses less personal data to display advertisements.""

The Commission is currently assessing the new option.

In both cases, the Commission says the size of the fine takes into account ""the gravity and duration of the non-compliance"".

Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines.

""Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,"" said Commissioner Teresa Ribera.

""As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules.""

Apple said the Commission had made ""a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.""

It also accused the Commission of ""[moving] the goal posts"" during their meetings.

Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses.

""This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,"" it said in a statement.

The fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction ofGoogle's €2.4bn finefrom last September.

But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation.

In February, Donald Trump's White House issueda memorandumcomplaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms.

""Today's decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,"" Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC.

Prof Witt said the disagreement was ""not so much about substantive antitrust principles,"" given the US government is itself takinga number of big tech companies to courtover alleged monopoly power.

They are more ""about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,"" she added.

One company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite.

They had along-running disputeover the distribution of their apps on Apple devices.

Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was ""great news for app developers worldwide"" ina thread on X.

He urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple's App Store, which charges fees for using its platform.

A US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision.

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission ""has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U.S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures.""

""The Commission's actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,"" it said.

The UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after adigital competition lawwas brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares.

""Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems andGoogle's general searchand search advertising services are currently being investigated for potentially having this status, and it is likely that other US tech giants and platforms will face similar investigations in the near future,"" said Andrew Maxwell, partner at law firm Freeths.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm248vzg9jwo
ChatGPT maker wants to buy Chrome from Google,An OpenAI executive told a US judge the company would be interested in buying the popular browser.,N/A,"Google, Artificial intelligence, Competition law",Imran Rahman-Jones,2025-04-23T09:54:45.092Z,2025-04-23T09:54:45.092Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/beda/live/405041a0-201c-11f0-93d4-c157523ad7ce.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/beda/live/405041a0-201c-11f0-93d4-c157523ad7ce.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dr6neg766o,"ChatGPT-maker OpenAI would be interested in buying Chrome, the world's most popular browser, if Google was forced to sell it.

Nick Turley, an executive at the artificial intelligence (AI) company, was testifying on behalf of the US government in an ongoing monopoly trial against Google.

The USwants the tech giant to be broken up,arguing it has too much dominance in the online search market.

But Google says Chrome is not for sale and has called for the antitrust lawsuit to be thrown out.

It is estimated that around 64% of people online use Chrome,according to analytics company Similarweb.

The next most popular browser, Apple's Safari, is used by 21% of people.

Mr Turley was testifying at the trial in Washington DC, the latest in a series of cases brought by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) against big tech dominance in social media, searching the internet and AI.

Last year, the court ruled Google had a monopolyin online search,while last week it was ruled to have an illegal monopolyin online advertising technology.

Google says it will appeal both decisions.

Its head of regulatory affairs, Lee-Anne Mulholland,said in a blogthe government's proposals ""would hurt America's consumers, economy, and technological leadership"".

The current trial is looking at remedies to curtail Google's dominance in online search, as the recent explosion in generative AI services such as ChatGPT has expanded the market.

Newer AI models search the internet to improve results and reduce hallucination, which has been a problem from developers since chatbots started to become popular.

Last year, OpenAI offered to do a deal with Google which would have integrated Google search results into ChatGPT, according to Mr Turley's testimony.

But he says their offer was rejected.

""We have no partnership with Google today,"" Mr Turley said,according to Reuters.

OpenAI does however have a partnership with Microsoft, which makes the Bing search engine and Edge browser.

Meanwhile, Google has its own suite of generative AI products such as Gemini - a direct competitor to ChatGPT.

The trial is expected to last three weeks and other big tech companies - including Meta, Amazon and Apple - will be keeping a close eye on it, given they are also facing their own monopoly lawsuits from the DOJ.

Separately, reports in the past week suggest OpenAI is looking into creating its own social network.

The Verge reportedthe project is ""still in early stages,"" but the company and its boss Sam Altman have privately been asking for feedback on a potential rival to X.

Elon Musk to step back from Doge as Tesla profits plunge,The tech boss says he intends to spend only one to two days a week on Trump administration matters.,Technology,"Elon Musk, International Business, Tesla, Donald Trump",Lily Jamali,2025-04-22T21:28:40.597Z,2025-04-23T09:16:40.196Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/54dd/live/0534ad00-200c-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/54dd/live/0534ad00-200c-11f0-8c2e-77498b1ce297.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0x50yr46lo,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has pledged to ""significantly"" cut back his role in the US government after the electric car firm reported a huge drop in profit and sales for the start of this year.

Musk has led the newly created advisory body - the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) - since last year, putting the world's richest man at the heart of cutting US spending and jobs.

But Musk said his ""time allocation to Doge"" would ""drop significantly"" from next month, adding he would spend only one to two days per week on it after accusations he has taken his focus off Tesla.

His political involvement has sparked protests and boycotts of Tesla cars around the world.

Temporary government employees, such as Musk, are normally limited to working 130 days a year which, if counted from the day of President Donald Trump's inauguration, is set to expire late next month.

But it is unclear when Musk, who contributed more than a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election, will step down completely.

Trump said earlier this month he would keep Musk ""as long as I could keep him"".

The tech boss said he would now ""be allocating far more of my time to Tesla"", but suggested he would not leave the Trump administration completely, calling the work ""critical"" and pledging to stay on ""as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it's useful"".

On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%.

The company warned investors that the pain could continue, declining to offer a growth forecast while saying ""changing political sentiment"" could meaningfully hurt demand.

Musk blamed the boycott of Tesla cars on people who would ""try to attack me and the Doge team"".

Shares in the company had shed about 37% of their value this year as of market close on Tuesday. They rose by more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results.

Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. ""Rapidly evolving trade policy"" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company.

""This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,"" Tesla's quarterly update said.

Musk hasclashedon trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.

On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were ""still tough on a company where margins are low"".

""I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,"" he said.

Earlier this month, he called Navarro a ""moron"" over comments he had made about Tesla. Navarro had said Musk was ""not a car manufacturer"" but a ""car assembler, in many cases"".

Georg Ell, who knew Musk and was director for Western Europe at Tesla, told the BBC's Today programme that if the multi-billionaire ""focuses on the companies where he is extraordinary, I think people will focus once again on the quality of the product and experiences"".

""I think Elon is not someone who surrounds himself with a great diversity of opinion to challenge his thinking, he's a pretty single-minded individual,"" added Mr Ell, who is now chief executive of translation software firm Phrase.

Tesla said artificial intelligence would contribute to future growth, though investors have been unconvinced by such arguments in the past.

Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, called expectations ""rock-bottom"" after the companysaidearlier this month that the number of cars sold in the quarter had fallen 13% to the lowest level in three years.

The firm faces fierce competition, Mr Coatsworth said, warning that potential disruption to global supply chains as a result of Trump's trade war also created risks.

""Tesla's problems are mounting,"" he said.

Researchers behind a new report have said they were able to set up accounts using fake birthdays and they were then shown sexualised content, hateful comments, and recommended adult accounts to follow.

Meta, which owns Instagram, says the report is ""filled with inaccuracies and demonstrates a misunderstanding"" of the Teen Accounts, and that parents ""find  these new protections helpful"".

The research, from online child safety charity 5Rights Foundation, is released as Ofcom, the UK regulator, is about to publish its children's safety codes.

They will outline the rules platforms will have to follow under the Online Safety Act. Platforms will then have three months to show that they have systems in place which protect children.

That includes robust age checks, safer algorithms which don't recommend harmful content, and effective content moderation.

Instagram Teen Accounts were set up in September 2024 to offer new protections for children and to create what Meta called ""peace of mind for parents"".

The new accounts were designed to limit who could contact users and reduce the amount of content young people could see.

Existing users would be transferred to the new accounts and those signing up for the first time would automatically get one.

But researchers from 5Rights Foundation were able to set up a series of fake Teen Accounts using false birthdays, with no additional checks by the platform.

They found that immediately on sign up they were offered adult accounts to follow and message.

Instagram's algorithms, they claim, ""still promote sexualised imagery, harmful beauty ideals and other negative stereotypes"".

The researchers said their Teen Accounts were also recommended posts ""filled with significant amounts of hateful comments"".

The charity also had concerns about the addictive nature of the app and exposure to sponsored, commercialised content.

Baroness Beeban Kidron founder of 5Rights Foundation said: ""This is not a teen environment.""

""They are not checking age, they are recommending adults, they are putting them in commercial situations without letting them know and it's deeply sexualised.""

Meta said the report was ""filled with inaccuracies and demonstrates a misunderstanding of how Teen Accounts work, which we could have clarified if [5Rights Foundation] had shared the report with us"".

A spokesperson said: ""We developed Teen Accounts following feedback from parents, and a recent survey showed that 94% of parents find these new protections helpful.

""Fundamentally changing Instagram for tens of millions of teens around the world is a big undertaking, and we know we will need to work tirelessly to get it right and bring parents peace of mind.""

In a separate development BBC News has also learned about the existence of groups dedicated to self-harm on X.

The groups or ""communities"", as they are known on the platform, contain tens of thousands of members sharing graphic images and videos of self-harm.

Some of the users involved in the groups appear to be children.

Becca Spinks, an American researcher who discovered the groups, said: ""I was absolutely floored to see 65,000 members of a community.""

""It was so graphic, there were people in there taking polls on where they should cut next.""

X was approached for comment, but did not respond.

But in a submission to an Ofcom consultation last year X said: ""We have clear rules in place to protect the safety of the service and the people using it.""

""In the UK, X is committed to complying with the Online Safety Act,"" it added.

Oblivion remaster: Elder Scrolls IV remake revealed and launched,"It is a long-awaited remaster of the classic video game, which originally released back in 2006.",Technology,Gaming,Liv McMahon & Tom Gerken,2025-04-22T15:48:35.391Z,2025-04-22T16:32:53.582Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2e73/live/7ae9b8c0-1f8e-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2e73/live/7ae9b8c0-1f8e-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y42wvjrd3o,"Video game studio Bethesda has announced the long-rumoured launch of a remastered version of its 2006 hit Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

The fourth instalment of the series has maintained a cult following among fans despite it being almost two decades since its original release.

Now, gamers have been surprised as a remaster of the classic game has not only been announced - but released to digital stores immediately.

It comes as fans await the next game in the series, with the most recent entry - Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - having been released in 2011.

More than 600,000 people watched the live announcement on YouTube.

And the reveal that the game would be available immediately drew shock and excitement from those watching, with many viewers writing ""Praise be Todd"" in the comments - in reference to Bethesda director Todd Howard.

In 2006, Oblivion launched on PC and the Xbox 360 console as the product of a co-publishing agreement between Bethesda and Take-Two Interactive's label, 2K Games.

""Oblivion was a really defining moment in the series,"" Howard said in the announcement.

""I think with a remaster, we want people to feel the way they did then - but it's still a game of its time, you want to keep the bones in place,"" he said.

Bethesda showed off a series of significant graphics upgrades in its launch video, with updated gameplay, user interface and audio systems.

Players will also be able to upgrade their characters in a new way, combining systems both from the original and the sequel.

One of the developers called the remaster ""a love letter"" to the original game.

Set in the open world of Tamriel, the game places players in an empire on the verge of downfall - after the mysterious death of Emperor Uriel Septim VII leaves behind a vacant throne and missing heir.

Rachel Howie, a content creator and Twitch partner, said the game was ""long overdue the currently very trendy remaster treatment"".

""It's such a great opportunity for the generation who grew up thinking Skyrim was peak role-playing game to meet its charming little brother,"" she added.

Oblivion racked up 9.5m salesaccording to gaming website Polygon, and is fondly remembered by fans.

Skyrim then released five years later to a massive response, selling more than 40 million copies across generations of consoles - it has been re-released on two generations of consoles since it first came out.

The news will now leave fans wondering if they may now soon see some news about Elder Scrolls 6, which was announced in 2018, some seven years after Skyrim's release.

Since then, information on the game has been sparse, and mostly limited to rumours.

But gamers have come to expect a long wait from Bethesda, which is facing demand for a new Fallout game as well - which remains under wraps despite the success of a hit Amazon TV show based on the series.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y42wvjrd3o

The UK retailer said its Click and Collect service had been impacted by technical issues along with its ability to collect contactless payments - with many customers taking to social media to complain about delays.

M&S chief executive Stuart Machin apologised to customers in a note on Tuesday.

He said the company had been forced to temporarily make ""small changes"" to store operations ""to protect you and our business"".

""There is no need for you to take any action at this time and if the situation changes, we will let you know,"" he said.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's data watchdog, has been notified.

""Marks & Spencer plc has made us aware of an incident and we are assessing the information provided,"" an ICO spokesperson told the BBC.

In anotice to investors, M&S said it had engaged ""external cyber security experts to assist with investigating and managing the incident"".

""We are taking actions to further protect our network and ensure we can continue to maintain customer service,"" it added.

The company said it also reported the incident to the National Cyber Security Centre.

M&S told customers it was working to resolve some ""limited"" delays to Click and Collect orders.

It comes after some shoppers complained over the weekend about various issues - including being unable to use gift cards or vouchers in stores.

One person called the issues a ""total failure for customers""in a post on X.

""A simple message out to customers to save a journey would have worked a treat,"" they said.

And another said they wereunable to pay for clothes using a gift cardwhile shopping at a M&S store in Liverpool.

M&S has confirmed it is still experiencing technical difficulties affecting its ability to process gift cards, alongside Click and Collect orders.

Daniel Card of the Chartered Institute for IT (BCS) said the M&S incident was ""a reminder of the gap that often exists between our perception of cyber resilience and the reality"".

""Even well-resourced organisations aren't immune, which underlines the importance of action at every level,"" he said.

He said while this may feel daunting for some smaller organisations, many common vulnerabilities ""can be addressed through practical, proportionate steps"".

These may include securing devices and email accounts to protect from targeted attempts to compromise a person or business.

This is just the latest in a series of IT problems to hit major high street names.

Morrisonsexperienced significant problemswith their Christmas orders last year, with deliveries cancelled and discounts not applied on the biggest grocery shopping day of the year.

This was followed by two major outages on what was pay day for many in the first two months of this year.

And in January, serious IT problems at Barclaysaffected the bank's app and online banking.

It was later disclosed the firm could face compensation payments of £12.5m.

In February, several banks – notably Lloyds – faced outages,leaving businesses unable to pay staff.

Ian McShane, a security expert at cyber security company Arctic Wolf, said the issues experienced by M&S over Easter showed that ""cyber attackers never take a day off"".

""Criminals are always on the look out to cause the most disruption for the least amount of effort,"" he added.

""Given the long weekend is the second biggest trading event for food and drink retailers after Christmas, this is exactly what happened here as the majority of the British public enjoyed the long weekend.""

"Films made with AI can win Oscars, Academy says",But it said it would still consider human involvement when selecting winners.,Technology,"Artificial intelligence, Film",Liv McMahon,2025-04-22T11:15:11.734Z,2025-04-22T11:15:11.734Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6bb0/live/c35e9800-1f70-11f0-b265-abe347419ae3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6bb0/live/c35e9800-1f70-11f0-b265-abe347419ae3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx4y1lrz2vo,"Films made with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) will be able to win top awards at the Oscars, according to its organisers.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences issued new rules on Monday which said the use of AI and other digital tools would ""neither help nor harm the chances of achieving a nomination"".

Generative AI -  which can create text, images, audio and video in response to simple text prompts - helped to produce some of the films awarded top industry accolades in March.

But the Academy said it would still consider human involvement when selecting its winners.

The Academy said its new language around eligibility for films made using generative AI tools was recommended by its Science and Technology Council.

Under further rule changes announced on Monday, Academy members must now watch all nominated films in each category in order to be able to take part in the final round of voting, which decides upon winners.

The use of AI in film became a hot topic after Adrian Brody took home the award for Best Actor for his role in The Brutalist at this year's Oscars ceremony in March.

The movie used generative AI to improve the actor's accent when he spoke Hungarian.

It then emerged similar voice-cloning technology was used to enhance singing voices in the Oscar-winning musical Emilia Perez.

The technology's ability to quickly alter or match the tone and style of an artist, or perform edits such as subtly changing someone's appearance, has helped it become  more popular in the production of music and film.

But AI use remains controversial, and artists and actors have voiced concerns over the material used to train such tools and its impact upon their livelihoods.

Actors and screenwriters previously highlighted fears about losing work to AI during the 2023 strikes in Hollywood.

""If you can take my face, my body and my voice and make me say or do something that I had no choice about, that's not a good thing,"" actress Susan Sarandontold the BBC from a picket line.

And screenwriters are concerned studios would seek to cut costs and save time by using tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT for tasks such as researching, treatment and script writing, instead of humans.

Safeguards around the use of AI were established as part of the agreements reached between unions and studios that marked the end of the strikes.

But while some actors have seemingly embraced the technology, others, such as Scarlett Johansson,have issued warningsabout its potential to allow abuse of their image or likeness.

Animatorstold the BBC in 2024generative AI tools were not yet good enough to be able to replicate the quality of their work - certainly not to an award-winning standard.

""It's like having a bad writer help you,"" said Jonathan Kendrick, co-founder and chairman of global streaming service Rokit Flix.

""Sure it will get an outline done, but if you need something with emotional weight, an AI isn't going to get you an Oscar.""

"US sets tariffs of up to 3,521% on South East Asia solar panels",Several Chinese solar companies with factories across the region could face steep new tariffs.,Business,"Solar power, International Business, Trade war, Global trade",João da Silva,2025-04-22T06:14:32.737Z,2025-04-22T06:49:22.270Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/933e/live/9c106800-1fe8-11f0-89df-fbfd5d939728.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/933e/live/9c106800-1fe8-11f0-89df-fbfd5d939728.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ygdv47vlzo,"The US Commerce Department has announced plans to impose tariffs of up to 3,521% on imports of solar panels from four South East Asian countries.

It comes after an investigation that began a year ago when several major solar equipment producers asked the administration of then-President Joe Biden to protect their US operations.

The proposed levies - targeting companies in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam - are in response to allegations of subsidies from China and the dumping of unfairly cheap products in the US market.

A separate US government agency, the International Trade Commission, is due to reach a final decision on the new tariffs in June.

The countervailing and anti-dumping duties, as these tariffs are known, vary between companies and the countries their products are made in.

Some solar equipment exporters in Cambodia face the highest duties of 3,521% because of what was seen as a lack of cooperation with the Commerce Department investigation.

Products made in Malaysia by Chinese manufacturer Jinko Solar faced some of the lowest duties of just over 41%.

Another China-based firm, Trina Solar, faces tariffs of 375% for the products it makes in Thailand.

Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment from BBC News.

In recent years, many Chinese firms have moved operations to South East Asia in a bid to avoid tariffs imposed since the start of US President Donald Trump's first term.

The US Commerce Department's findings were welcomed by the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee - a group of manufacturers that called on the US government to launch the investigation.

""This is a decisive victory for American manufacturing and confirms what we've long known: that Chinese-headquartered solar companies have been cheating the system,"" said Tim Brightbill, lead counsel to the Alliance.

In 2023, America imported almost $12bn (£8.9bn) in solar equipment from the four countries, according to US Census Bureau figures.

While the planned tariffs are likely to help US solar panel manufacturers, they could also mean extra costs for businesses and consumers who have benefited from the availability of cheaper solar products.

The levies would be imposed on top of other tariffs already rolled out by the Trump administration.

The planned tariffs were announced just days after Chinese President Xi Jinping completed a tour of Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia.

The trip was aimed to boost ties with the region and encourage those nations to resist what he called ""unilateral bullying"" by the US.

Trump has so far imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. Other countries are now facing a blanket US tariff of 10% until July.

His administration said last week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones, the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.

Lilly Sabri: I won't put my relationships on social media again,The influencer explains how she rebuilt her life after a podcast implicated her fiancé had had an affair.,Technology,"Social media, YouTubers, Technology",Zoe Kleinman,2025-04-19T01:29:31.519Z,2025-04-19T01:29:31.519Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/574f/live/655f2e00-15f6-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/574f/live/655f2e00-15f6-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g22mvmkmeo,"""Be mindful about what you're sharing, because once it's online, it's online forever,"" says Lilly Sabri.

The fitness influencer, who has six million followers on YouTube, has urged fans to heed her words as she plans to return to Instagram after a long absence.

Two years ago she was living her dream, running two successful businesses helped by her explosion in popularity during the Covid lockdowns.

But the physiotherapist went silent on Instagram in 2023 when a popular gossip podcast shared a story about a man who had allegedly cheated on his well-known fiancée - with enough clues to suggest the man in question was her then partner.

She woke to find ""thousands"" of notifications from social media and messaging apps as seemingly the whole world wanted to know whether there was truth behind the rumours.

Lilly was watching the life she knew fall apart in real time.

The creators of the podcast, which the BBC has chosen not to name, say they are not responsible for actions taken as a result of their content.

Lilly - who has not discussed what happened in public until now - sat down with me to talk about the moment which changed her future.

Soon after the podcast launched, her social media feeds began to fill with what she called ""investigator-style"" videos speculating about her life and how she would react.

Her first step was to delete her Instagram app.

""I just had to get away from social media,"" she said.

""People wanted answers, people wanted to see even more into my life, even when I asked for privacy.

""All I could do was control my own reaction and that meant withdrawing and protecting myself and my family.""

Lilly's relationship ended, but there was much to untangle - her ex was also her business partner, leaving her faced with raising the funds to buy him out. He has been contacted by the BBC for comment.

She left Dubai, where she had been living with her partner, to move back in with her family in the UK - and had to lay off most of the companies' staff.

""It was very humbling and very difficult,"" Lilly said, explaining she had to go back to doing the work she used to have staff for - such as editing, filming her videos, and running the business' social media feeds.

It meant even though she was trying her best to avoid it, Lilly was constantly engaging with social media platforms to keep her businesses going - and she had to try to avoid looking at myriad personal comments.

""I was trying to manage the heartbreak and the shock combined with keeping the business afloat,"" she said.

Her most recent Instagram post until now, on her personal account, was uploaded in November 2023 - with many of the comments asking why she has not posted for so long.

Up until the gossip podcast launched, Lilly had been open about her life online.

And she accepted there may have ""potentially"" been less interest in her relationship had she shared less on social media.

""I truly don't know the answer to that,"" she said.

""I think when I compare to some other people, I didn't show a lot of my lifestyle.

""But it was clearly enough for people to put two and two together.""

Lilly acknowledged she had shared snapshots about herself to help build her brand - to draw in those who wanted to know more about her - and for a long time it was a successful strategy.

While she maintained some boundaries such as not revealing information about her family, she said there was always an unspoken pressure to share more.

""I've learned people will constantly want more the more you give,"" she said.

""If it's just showing your dog, or sharing your relationship, it's like 'okay, what else, now show the house'.

""It can lead to a lot of exposure because you're chasing likes or you feel that's what your customers want.""

Nearly eighteen months after her most recent post, Lilly is in a different headspace.

Her business - the workout videos and a nutrition app - are thriving and she feels ready to return to her personal Instagram account - but with a very different set of rules this time around.

""I'm not going to be showing my personal relationships, I've been too scarred, and I can't do it again,"" she said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g22mvmkmeo

Can they break up? ,Asia,"iPhones, International business, Technology, Asia, China, Apple",Annabelle Liang,2025-04-18T22:56:24.399Z,2025-04-18T22:56:24.399Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f86a/live/3d6b7190-16a2-11f0-b2d2-fdaed6fdfe2b.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f86a/live/3d6b7190-16a2-11f0-b2d2-fdaed6fdfe2b.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czx17361pw1o,"Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.

While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.

Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.

Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exemptedsmartphones, computers and some other electronic devicesfrom his tariffs last week.

But the comfort is short-lived.

The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: ""NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',"" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated ""semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN"".

The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.

The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?

China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.

Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.

Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.

It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.

As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.

Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into ""manufacturing superstars,"" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.

He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became ""the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,"" Mr Lin says.

Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.

As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed ""iPhone City"".

For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.

Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.

Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.

""There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,"" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.

InTrump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.

But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.

""The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: ""President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.""

She added: ""At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.""

But many are sceptical of that.

The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is ""pure fantasy,"" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.

He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.

Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but ""really made an effort"" after the pandemic, whenChina's tightly controlled Covid lockdownshurt manufacturing output.

""The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].""

Apple did not respond to the BBC's questionsbut its website says its supply chainspans ""thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries"".

Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.

Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.

""Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,"" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.

It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.

There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.

And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.

""All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,"" Mr Friedman says.

So what does Apple do now?

The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.

Now that ""Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,"" according to Mr Lin.

Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It evenoffered rare discountson iPhones in January to boost sales.

And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had tolimit the use of Bluetooth and Airdropon its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that eventouched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.

Apple has announced a $500bn (£378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.

Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.

Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add ""pressure - both operationally and politically"" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.

""Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,"" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.

""But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.""

Artists push back against Barbie-like AI dolls with their own creations,Artists hit back on social media to warn artificial intelligence may be endangering their livelihoods.,N/A,"Social media, Artificial intelligence, Art, Technology",Richard Irvine-Brown & Liv McMahon,2025-04-19T00:39:08.981Z,2025-04-19T00:39:08.981Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/359b/live/471d2b90-1c54-11f0-8454-03622c874820.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/359b/live/471d2b90-1c54-11f0-8454-03622c874820.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v9z45pe93o,"Artists and creatives are pushing back against a recent trend using artificial intelligence (AI) to generate ""starter pack"" images of people as toys - which they say may be in danger of risking their livelihoods.

Since the start of April, thousands of people have uploaded their photos togenerate images of themselves as dolls, despite warnings of damaging the environment, giving away personal information, and devaluing creativity.

Nick Lavallee,who has made custom action figures for six years, told the BBC he was concerned his work may be at risk after ""AI images saturated social media"".

""People are sick of them,"" he said. ""It's an artistic aesthetic - AI-generated art diminishes that.""

Nick has made figures of - and for - comedians, film directors, and artists such as Weezer and Tyler Childers, which sell for as much as $250 (£188) online on his Wicked Joyful website.

His success has led to a clothing brand and will soon be followed by a physical shop in his hometown of Manchester, New Hampshire.

But he's concerned action figure commissions could soon dry up, as well as the public perception of his work, from thousands of AI images mimicking his passion.

The feeling has been shared by other creatives with the rise of the #StarterPackNoAI movement, which has been used thousands of times since first appearing on Instagram in early April before spreading to X soon after.

After Patouret's post, others quickly joined the counter-trend, with artist Maria Picassó Piquer saying she chose to take part ""for fun, but also as a statement"".

""While AI pieces all looked more or less the same, I was amazed at the variety of the 'human' works,"" she said.

""Plus, self-portraits added an extra layer of, well, humanity.""

Maria, like many other artists, sees the dual risk of AI images threatening intellectual property rights by being ""fed on 'stolen' art"", and the possibility of reducing her finding new clients.

Illustrator Dav le Dessineux, working in Bordeaux, France, said some in his industry had already lost contracts to AI design work.

He contributed his starter pack because ""like many artists who use their real hands"", he was ""tired"" of the deluge of AI-generated doll images.

Dav's illustration featured only a pencil and sheet of white paper - tools he said are ""all you need to start being an artist"".

""People usually forget about it because of the technology surrounding us, but we really don't need more than basic stuff to create something and be original,"" he said.

Eli Dibitonto, an artist living in Barletta, Italy, agreed, describing the process of digitally illustrating his own starter pack as ""carefree and fun"".

""It doesn't have to be perfect - mine isn't,"" he said. ""Art isn't meant to be perfect or look flawless.""

And illustrator and student Evie Joyce said creating her own artwork meant being able to consider what to reflect of her personality during a process lasting several hours, rather than seconds.

""I think that what's so magical about it is you're seeing people put time and effort and their personality, all of their experiences, into pieces of art,"" she said.

""With AI, it can even steal from artists and steal their work and their style, it just loses that touch of personality.""

Back in New Hampshire, Nick understands the rebellion from illustrators, but says he believes there is use for AI.

""I don't necessarily want to say AI is bad when I know that it could be a useful tool,"" he said.

""I think all of us have experimented with it.""

And Henk van Ess, a global expert in using AI in investigative research, has proven how useful it can be - but it would be safe to say he does not believe it lies in starter packs.

""It's like watching a supercomputer calculate how many Hobnobs fit in a Sports Direct mug, while solving climate change sits on the 'to-do' list,"" he said.

""Technically impressive? Sure. But it's the technological equivalent of using the Large Hadron Collider to heat up your Pot Noodle.

""While everyone's busy generating these digital equivalents of small talk, they're missing the actually revolutionary stuff AI can do - it's just wasteful to put all that energy into creating digital fluff when we can use it for solving real-world problems.""

And Nick remains positive.

""The musicians who get my stuff, who are excited to hold a Wicked Joyful in their hands, they know it's my artwork, they know it's mine,"" he said.

Likewise, Dav is confident in the worth of human work.

Despite the rise of pre-fabricated furniture, he says, ""people still call on cabinetmakers"".

""I hope I'll be one of those artisans,"" he said.

Nick, who says he found his purpose ""in bringing joy to people"" with his creations, said he similarly wanted to remain hopeful about the future.

""I really hope people are totally sick of AI action figures,"" he said.

""But I hope that they are smart enough to understand the difference in something that I'm doing versus what is computer-generated.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v9z45pe93o
"Nvidia, the chip giant caught between the US and China","Led by Jensen Huang, dubbed the 'Taylor Swift of tech', the chip giant has become pivotal in the race for AI supremacy.",Asia,"Asia, China, Artificial intelligence, Nvidia, China-US relations",James Chater,2025-04-18T08:42:48.991Z,2025-04-18T08:42:48.991Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f36d/live/fc723a70-1c19-11f0-ad6b-9b308fd76963.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f36d/live/fc723a70-1c19-11f0-ad6b-9b308fd76963.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedy6gl99eno,"Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology.

On Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips.

The California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard ""national and economic security"". Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the ""indefinite future"".

But why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China?

Nvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT.

In recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.

Because its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China.

Washington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.

US restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new.

In 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions.

A more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China.

However, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs.

DeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips.

Now, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.

Those companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (£4.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil.

Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei.

Although they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips.

""It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,"" Mr Lee added.

China is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year,  though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half.

The timing of Mr Huang's trip is being seen as an effort to shore up Nvidia's business in China despite the latest curbs.

In his Beijing meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Mr Huang said he hoped ""to continue to cooperate with China"", according to state broadcaster CCTV.

On Thursday, the Financial Times reported that Mr Huang's trip to China also included a meeting with DeepSeek's founder, Liang Wenfeng.

Separately, top Chinese official He Lifeng told Mr Huang that ""China's market investment and consumption potential is huge"", according to state news agency Xinhua.

During talks with Shanghai's mayor on Friday, Mr Huang said he was committed to the Chinese market, according to a Shanghai government statement.

The controls are part of Washington's broader goal to de-risk supply chains for advanced technology away from China, and bring more semiconductor production back to the US.

Nvidia this week announced plans to build up AI servers in the US worth up to $500bn. US president Donald Trump later claimed his re-election drove Nvidia's decision.

And in March, Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC, which manufactures Nvidia's chips, announced it would invest an additional $100bn in advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona.

Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis, told the BBC the latest developments show that global technology is becoming increasingly polarised between ""two systems"", one dominated by the US and the other by China.

""Tech will be less global in that sense, and it will be subject to more restrictions.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedy6gl99eno

Tesla whistleblower wins latest legal battle in fight against Musk,Engineer Cristina Balan raised a safety concern about a design flaw which could affect the cars' braking in 2014.,Technology,"Elon Musk, Tesla, Technology",Graham Fraser,2025-04-17T01:16:50.981Z,2025-04-17T09:41:26.836Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/057d/live/f4e7a3a0-1af0-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/057d/live/f4e7a3a0-1af0-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevdz4yxpd9o,"A Tesla whistleblower who has fought Elon Musk and his company through the courts for years has won the latest round of a long-running legal battle.

Engineer Cristina Balan lost her job after she raised a safety concern in 2014 about a design flaw which could affect the cars' braking.

Her defamation claim against the firm seemed to have run out of road when a judge confirmed an arbitration decision dismissing her case - but a panel of appeal judges in Californiahas reversed this decision in her favour.

She told BBC News she now wants to face Elon Musk and Tesla in open court.

Tesla has not responded to a request for comment.

Ms Balan said she believes the case will now in effect go back to square one, and new proceedings can be launched.

""We are hoping we will start a new lawsuit and we will have the chance to take on Elon Musk in front of a jury and judge,"" she said.

The engineer was once so prominent at Tesla that her initials were engraved on the batteries inside Model S vehicles.

In an interview with BBC News last year,she said she is determined to prove her innocence for the sake of her son.

She also revealed she was in remission from stage-3B breast cancer, and her biggest worry was she may not live to see her final day in court.

Ms Balan claimed she was worried the carpets were curling underneath some pedals in Tesla models, creating a safety hazard.

She said managers rebuffed her concerns, became hostile, and she lost her job.

She then won a wrongful dismissal case - but this turned out to be the start of a long journey through the courts.

Ms Balan was publicly accused by Tesla of using its resources for a ""secret project"" - accusations which amount to embezzlement, a crime under US law.

She has consistently denied the accusation, and decided to bring a defamation case against the firm in 2019.

""I want to clear my name,"" she told BBC News last year.

""I wish Elon Musk had the decency to apologise.""

A court then decided Ms Balan's case should be subject to arbitration per a contract she signed while working for Tesla.

The arbitrator found in favour of the firm and Musk, dismissing her claims, due to California's statute of limitations - meaning too much time had passed since the alleged defamatory statements were made.

Tesla brought the case back to a district court in California to have the decision confirmed.

However, Ms Balan appealed this decision, and judges from the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found in her favour - in effect deciding the California court did not have the jurisdiction to make its judgement.

They have ordered for the confirmation of the arbitration award to be cancelled, and for the district court to dismiss the action due to its lack of jurisdiction.

The majority of legal experts the BBC has spoken to believe the case has some way to go before there will be any conclusion.

""Tesla is among the many corporations that force employees and customers into opaque arbitration processes and deploy aggressive strategies to retaliate against employees who voice criticism of corporate practices,"" said Stanford professor Anat Admati.

And Bill Moran, Ms Balan's attorney, agreed the legal process is far from over.

But he said the case was ""revived"" by the latest ruling.

""We are confident we can secure her either a new arbitration or alternatively a trial in court so that her case can be heard on the merits after so many years,"" he said.

""She has fought cancer while waging this case... she is the epitome of strength and resolve, and she is now one step closer to getting the justice she deserves.""

The US Department of Justice, along with 17 US states, sued Google, arguing the tech giant was illegally dominating the technology which determines which adverts should be placed online and where.

This is the second antitrust case Google has lost in a year, after it was ruled the company also had amonopoly on online search.

Google said it would appeal against the decision.

""Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective,"" the firm's head of regulatory affairs Lee-Ann Mulholland said.

US district judge Leonie Brinkema saidin the rulingGoogle had ""wilfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts"" which enabled it to ""acquire and maintain monopoly power"" in the market.

""This exclusionary conduct substantially harmed Google's publisher customers, the competitive process, and, ultimately, consumers of information on the open web,"" she said.

Google lost on two counts, while a third was dismissed.

""We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,"" Ms Mulholland said.

""The court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don't harm competition.""

The ruling is a significant win for US antitrust enforcers, according to Laura Phillips-Sawyer, a professor at the University of Georgia School of Law.

""It signals that not only are agencies willing to prosecute but also that judges are willing to enforce the law against big tech firms,"" she said.

She said the verdict sets an important legal precedent and is likely to affect decision-making in corporate America.

Google's lawyers had argued the case focused too much on its past activities, and prosecutors ignored other large ad tech providers such as Amazon.

""Google has repeatedly used its market power to self-preference its own products, stifling innovation and depriving premium publishers worldwide of critical revenue needed to sustain high-quality journalism and entertainment,"" said Jason Kint, head of Digital Content Next, a trade association representing online publishers.

Google owns large companies on the buyer and seller sides of the online advertising market, as well as an ad exchange which matches demand and supply.

Internet users will not notice a difference online as a result of the decision, said Anupam Chander, professor of law and technology at Georgetown University.

But it affects ""the division of monies between advertisers, publishers, and ad service providers"".

""The judge seems willing to order structural changes in Google's ad exchange practices, which may affect Google's bottom line somewhat, but don't seem to necessarily threaten its core value proposition as an advertising middleman,"" he added.

In an ongoing series of antitrust lawsuits, the US government argues Google and its parent company Alphabet should be broken up - which could include selling off parts of the company such as the Chrome browser.

The US case will now move to a second ""remedies"" phase, which could also lead to Alphabet being broken up, said John Kwoka, a professor of economics at Northeastern University.

Discord's face scanning age checks 'start of a bigger shift',The social platform is testing age checks using facial scanning for access to sensitive content.,Technology,"Facial recognition, Social media, Ofcom, Social media regulation debate",Imran Rahman-Jones & Chris Vallance,2025-04-17T12:13:58.654Z,2025-04-17T18:13:56.778Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/efe0/live/38684c70-1b6d-11f0-b405-a9063c038ff6.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/efe0/live/38684c70-1b6d-11f0-b405-a9063c038ff6.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr75wypg0vo,"Discord is testing face scanning to verify some users' ages in the UK and Australia.

The social platform, which says it has over 200 million monthly users around the world, was initially used by gamers but now has communities on a wide range of topics including pornography.

The UK's online safety laws mean platforms with adult content will need to have ""robust"" age verificationin place by July.

And social media expert Matt Navarra told the BBC ""this isn't a one-off - it's the start of a bigger shift"".

""Regulators want real proof, and facial recognition might be the fastest route there,"" he said.

But campaigners have said these types of checks are ineffective and could lead to privacy issues.

""Age assurance is becoming the new seatbelt for the internet,"" said Mr Navarra.

""Will it become the norm in the UK? Honestly, yes, probably.""

He said he believed the incoming changes in online safety laws mean online platforms would beef up their age verification processes.

""The era of 'click here to confirm you're 13' is dead,"" he said.

""Get age verification wrong now, and you don't just lose users - you could lose a courtroom battle or incur fines.""

Firms which do not comply with the Online Safety Act could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover.

Instagram previously brought inage checks using facial analysisin 2022 for users who want to change their profile settings to be over 18.

The social media company requires users to take a selfie video on their phone and uses AI to estimate the person's age.

Like Discord, they can alternatively upload a picture of their photo ID.

The US-based platform says the verification - which it describes as ""an experiment"" - will be a one-time check.

It will apply the first time a user comes across content which it has flagged as sensitive, or if they change their settings on viewing sensitive media.

Users can either use the face scanner or upload a photo of their ID to confirm their age.

It says information used for age checks will not be stored by Discord or the verification company.

Face scans will stay on the device and not be collected, and ID uploads will be deleted after the verification is complete,according to the company.

Content which is flagged as sensitive is already automatically blocked or blurred for teenagers.

Privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch says age check technology ""shouldn't be seen as a silver bullet solution"".

Senior advocacy officer Madeleine Stone says they can pose a risk to users, ""including security breaches, privacy intrusion, errors, digital exclusion and censorship"".

While industry group the Age Verification Providers Association says there is a ""wide range of convenient, privacy-preserving methods"".

Their executive director Iain Corby told the BBC the latest technology can estimate age ""within one to two years based on a selfie or how you move your hands"".

But he also said platforms have a choice on how to use age verification.

""They can remove the harmful content altogether, apply age checks to access the whole site, or just check ages before allowing access to high-risk pages and posts,"" he said.

Australia is planning to bring in a social media ban for all under-16s this year.

Recent researchfound more than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s

Mechanic Mr Rudd was selling more than £1,000 worth of power tools on a social media platform when he received a message from a profile named Liam Wright.

When ""Mr Wright"" said he was interested in viewing them, Mr Rudd invited him to come to his workshop in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

After the man arrived, he checked over the tools, offered a bank transfer and opened what appeared to be a banking app.

""He handed his phone over to me and I typed in my account details, clicked send, and it came up with a successful payment notification,"" Mr Rudd said.

""It looked absolutely genuine.""

While Mr Rudd was waiting for the money to appear in his bank account, he turned his back to pick up accessories to hand over as part of the sale.

The scammer used this opportunity to leave with all the tools, but the money never arrived in Mr Rudd's bank account.

""He came into my workplace and took my tools,"" Mr Rudd said.

""It angered me so much that someone could be so brazen, but it's also embarrassing that I allowed this to happen.""

Mr Rudd resigned from his job because he said the scam had ""a huge impact"" on his mental health.

""You lose faith in humanity, that someone could be that low,"" he said.

Wiltshire Police told Mr Rudd it will not be taking any further action as it has been unable to identify the suspect since the incident on 11 February.

It was a similar story for John Reddock, from Liverpool.

He was selling a gold bracelet in the hope he could use the money to take his two children on holiday to Spain.

He also used a social media platform to advertise the item, which he listed for £2,000.

""I was trying to do something nice for my kids and it backfired on me,"" said Mr Reddock.

Two men arrived at his house to view the bracelet and decided they were happy to go ahead with the purchase, offering a bank transfer.

Mr Reddock told them his bank account details and one of them typed it into what appeared to be a banking app on their phone.

It then showed a payment successful notification.

They left with the bracelet but Mr Reddock never received the money.

""It's given me nightmares and sleepless nights. I'm disgusted about what they've done to me,"" he said.

""It's made me really angry because I was trying to do something good for my kids, and they came to my property to steal from me.""

Mr Reddock reported the incident to the police but no further action was taken.

BBC West Investigations found the fake banking apps - which we are not naming so as not to promote them - are available to download onto an Android phone directly from the internet.

Dr Day said: ""So much of fraud is now happening online that it's easy to drop our guards when dealing with people in person.

""It gives us a false sense of security but fraud and scams are just as likely to happen in this space.""

Dr Day said it also shows how scams are becoming ""more complex and sophisticated"".

""The amount of money which is available as a result of fraud is so huge and the relative levels of enforcement possible means it's a crime type which is attracting more and more professional criminals,"" he added.

He said that tech companies need to be ""more engaged"" in driving out fraud on online platforms.

UK Finance represents more than 300 firms in the UK's banking and financial industry. A spokesperson said the fake banking app scam is ""a concern"" and they gave the following safety advice:

More information about staying safe from scamscan be found here.

But this is of little comfort to Sebastian Liberek, who runs his business Seb's Repairs in Gloucester.

He sells and repairs phones, tablets and computers and has been targeted by fraudsters – who walked directly into his shop - using fake banking apps on three occasions in recent months.

He said he has lost hundreds of pounds to a bank transfer faked by a customer.

""It makes you feel angry and vulnerable,"" Mr Liberek said.

""When you've spent 15 years building a business and someone can chip at it and take pieces away without consequences.""

Mr Liberek has now installed extra security measures such as CCTV to protect his business from future attempts.

""The fact it's happened three times, it will probably happen a fourth time,"" he said.

""There's nowhere to go, you cannot find them, you can report them to police, but chances of anything being done about it are fairly slim.

""It's a situation without answer, or ending.""

A government spokesperson said they  were taking ""ambitious steps to tackle the evolving threat of fraud"".

""In the coming months, we will set out further details including plans to strengthen international cooperation, introduce better protections against AI-enabled fraud, and increase collaboration between government and the private sector,"" they added.

Spotify 'back and functioning normally' after global outage,"Downdetector, which tracks platforms, showed more than 20,000 people reported Spotify was not working on Wednesday.",Technology,"Spotify, Internet",Tom Gerken & Chris Vallance,2025-04-16T13:11:54.516Z,2025-04-16T16:54:17.258Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0234/live/7cdda210-1ac3-11f0-8699-af8a0981754f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0234/live/7cdda210-1ac3-11f0-8699-af8a0981754f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde2rz199y5o,"Spotify says it has fixed an outage that left tens of thousands of users around the world unable to stream music on the app.

The firm said the platform was now ""back up and functioning normally"".

Spotify has not explained what caused the problems, but it had earlier said reports of a ""security hack"" were ""completely inaccurate"".

Downdetector, which tracks problems with online services, showed 20,000 people reported Spotify was not working at around 13:30 GMT Wednesday.

Spotify says it has more than 675 million users worldwide.

During the outage users reported they were still able to play music they had downloaded onto their device, however they were unable to view artists or use the search function on the app.

After trying to search for music, the app appeared to time out and displayed a message reading ""something went wrong"" with a refresh button.

""We're aware of some issues right now and are checking them out,"" the firmwrote on social mediain response to rising complaints from users.

On social media a number of users told the company they were unhappy with the outage, and the impact the loss of music was having.

One urged the platform to hurry up and fix the issue as they were at the gym, while another pleaded for a quick fix as the loss of music was disrupting their revision.

More significantly, some said they would switch to rival streaming platforms such as YouTube or Apple Music.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde2rz199y5o
Trump tariffs: Shein and Temu warn US import taxes will push up prices,"The firms said operating expenses have risen ""due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs"".",Asia,"Asia, Trump tariffs, China, Donald Trump, Temu",Kelly Ng,2025-04-17T05:04:18.568Z,2025-04-17T05:04:18.568Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c3f8/live/a7aa1b50-1b67-11f0-b405-a9063c038ff6.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c3f8/live/a7aa1b50-1b67-11f0-b405-a9063c038ff6.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r8v2l8vwpo,"Chinese online retail giants Shein and Temu have warned US customers that goods will get pricier from next week, after President Donald Trump imposed hefty tariffs on goods from China.

In almost identical statements, the rival companies said they have seen operating expenses rise ""due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs"", adding they will make ""price adjustments"" from 25 April.

The shopping sites have gained tens of millions of customers in the US, attracted by their ultra-low prices.

Their popularity has put pressure on Amazon, prompting it to launch a new platform called Haul last November, featuring items for under $20 (£15.10).

Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has imposed taxes of up to 145% on imports from China. His administration said this week that when the new tariffs are added on to existing ones the levies on some Chinese goods could reach 245%.

Trump has also ended a duty-free exemption for goods worth less than $800, which helped Shein and Temu make rapid inroads to the US market.

US lawmakers on both sides had raised concerns about how these companies had""exploited"" the provision.

An estimated 1.4 billion packages entered the US under this arrangement last year, up from 140 million in 2013, according to US customs authorities.

Since Trump started imposing the tariffs, Shein and Temu have seen the ranking of their apps fall sharply.

Temu is now the 75th most downloaded free app on the US Apple Store, after having consistently taken one of the top five spots in the last two years. Shein is in 58th place, down from number 15 last month.

But other Chinese retail apps continue to be ranked highly in the US, including DHgate in second place and Alibaba's Taobao at number seven.

Shein and Temu have also slashed their advertising spending in the US.

Temu has ""turned off all their Google Shopping ads in the US"" as of 9 April, Mike Ryan, head of e-commerce insights at online advertising agency Smarter Ecommerce, said on LinkedIn.

Temu's average daily US advertising spend on social media platforms include Facebook, Instagram and YouTube fell by 31% in the two weeks leading to 13 April, compared with the past month.

Shein's average daily US ad spend fell by 19% over the same period, according to data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower.

In their statements, Temu and Shein encouraged customers to shop before higher prices kick in.

""We stand ready to make sure your orders arrive smoothly during this time.

""We're doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimize the impact on you. Our team is working hard to improve your shopping experience,"" the statements said.

Temu and Shein did not immediately respond to requests from the BBC for further comment.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3r8v2l8vwpo
Minister Lucy Powell's X account hacked to promote crypto scam,"The MP's office says ""steps were taken quickly to secure the account and remove misleading posts"".",Politics,"Lucy Powell, Cryptocurrency",Becky Morton,2025-04-15T11:15:20.665Z,2025-04-15T11:26:55.617Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cdb3/live/512b26b0-1a00-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cdb3/live/512b26b0-1a00-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr5drp0n8zjo,"Government minister Lucy Powell's X account has been hacked to promote a scam ""House of Commons"" cryptocurrency.

A string of now deleted posts on the House of Commons leader's account described the ""$HCC"" coin as ""a community-driven digital currency bringing people's power to the blockchain"".

The MP's office confirmed her account was hacked on Tuesday morning and said ""steps were taken quickly to secure the account and remove misleading posts"".

Other public figures with a large number of followers who have been targeted in a similar way by online hackers recently include BBC journalist Nick Robinson.

Some of the posts from Powell's account, which is verified by the platform and mentions her cabinet position in the bio, included an image of the House of Commons logo.

The MP for Manchester Central, who has nearly 70,000 followers on X, has been leader of the House of Commons since Labour won power last summer.

The role is responsible for planning and supervising the government's legislative programme, while also upholding the rights of backbench MPs.



Taking over X accounts to advertise scam crypto coins is a common method used by cyber criminals.

Fraudsters often take over accounts using phishing emails - scam emails containing links to websites that either access systems or trick users into sharing their passwords.

Passwords can also be obtained using leaked information from data breaches.

At that point cyber criminals take over the account and plan their posts around hastily spun up crypto coins that can only take a couple of hours to create and launch.

They hope that high-profile and trusted accounts might encourage people to buy some of the otherwise worthless coins so that they can make some money before it all get blocked and stopped.

Luke Nolan, a senior research associate at CoinShares, an asset management company specialising in digital assets, said the hack of Powell's account was an example of ""pump and dump"".

This is when the people who created the cryptocoin inflate its value, get others to invest, and then sell their majority share to get profit, but leave the coin worthless.

Mr Nolan said there had only been 34 transactions on the coin, which would have led to a profit of about £225.

A House of Commons spokesman said: ""UK Parliament takes cyber security extremely seriously.

""We provide advice to users - including Members - to make them aware of the risks and how to manage their digital safety; however, we do not comment on specific details of our cyber security policies.""

Action Fraud said there was a rise in social and email accounts being hacked in 2024, with 35,343 reports.

It advises setting up 2-step verification for accounts and using a strong, unique password of three random words.

Earlier this year Robinson, who presents BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said his X account was hacked after he clicked on an email he wrongly believed was sent to him by the social media platform.

Post on his account claimed he was launching a cryptocurrency called ""$Today"".

PS5 price increases by £40 as Sony cites 'challenging' conditions,"The digital, disc-free edition of Sony's console has increased by roughly £70 since it first went on sale.",Technology,"Gaming, Retailing, Sony, PlayStation",Liv McMahon,2025-04-14T09:32:47.171Z,2025-04-14T10:07:20.848Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/92e6/live/daff7790-190d-11f0-b8b1-9b1615dcb3c3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/92e6/live/daff7790-190d-11f0-b8b1-9b1615dcb3c3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82391x2kyo,"Sony has raised the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles worldwide, citing ""challenging"" market conditions.

The price of the digital edition of the PS5 console in the UK has increased by £40 to £429.99.

Its cost for European customers has risen by approximately €50 to €499.99.

The company pointed to high inflation and ""fluctuating exchange rates""in a blog post explaining its decision.

Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) executive Isabelle Tomatis said PS5 prices in Australia and New Zealand would also rise - including for physical versions that have a disc drive.

The company said the price of the physical edition of the console would not change in the UK.

But it has reduced the cost of its disc drives - which are required for those with digital consoles who want to play physical media - from £99.99 to £69.99 in the UK.

Piers Harding-Rolls, research director at Ampere Analysis, said the disc-free version of the PS5 had formed a larger share of Sony's total sales over the last 18 months.

He said this new price adjustment had brought ""the digital edition more into alignment with the standard version"".

While President Donald Trump hasrevealed a tariff exemption for some electronics, video game consoles are not thought to be among them.

Christopher Dring, who writes about the gaming industry in The Game Business newsletter, saidwhile Sony did not directly mention tariffs in its decision, their ""knock-on effect"" could have an impact on pricing worldwide.

""The US is the biggest market for video game consoles, and rather than simply increase prices there, it's possible the likes of PlayStation could increase pricing globally in an effort to protect, as best they can, the US market,"" he told the BBC.

""Ultimately, the era when game consoles went down in price over time is certainly over.""

The price increase comes as Nintendo's launch of its rival Switch 2 console was marred by the impact of US tariffs on markets worldwide.

It saidit would suspend US pre-orders for the deviceso it could ""assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions"".

And Mr Harding-Rolls said he felt Sony may have been given ""the green light to increase pricing"" due to theSwitch 2's £395 price tag.

""At its current pricing, the digital version would be cheaper than the Switch 2, leaving Sony with some breathing space to increase its pricing, while remaining competitive across the console hardware market,"" he said.

This is the second time Sony has increased the RRP for its latest console.

Its initial £360 price tag for the disc drive-free digital edition was seen as a low price at the time, as Sony sought to match its price to that of the Xbox Series X.

But itrose the price by £30 in 2022- meaning with the latest price increase, the digital edition of the PS5 has increased by roughly £70 since it first went on sale.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82391x2kyo

Finland's bid to win Europe's start-up crown,"Helsinki wants to become a top European start-up hub, but can it challenge London and Stockholm?",N/A,"World of Business, International Business, Technology of Business",Maddy Savage,2025-04-14T23:01:05.120Z,2025-04-14T23:01:05.120Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6686/live/95a1d9d0-106c-11f0-b234-07dc7691c360.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6686/live/95a1d9d0-106c-11f0-b234-07dc7691c360.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28y8jj4lxo,"Yellow diggers are shoring up mounds of earth, as construction workers prepare to lay the foundations for what's set to become the largest start-up campus in Europe.

The project is an expansion of Maria 01, a co-working and event space for entrepreneurs and investors, as well as larger corporations that want to collaborate with tech start-ups.

Its existing facilities across the street already house around 240 start-ups. They are spread across six buildings that used to make up the city's first hospital, founded in the 19th Century and notorious in Helsinki for treating patients with the plague.

Now, the current 20,000 sq m site is a hub for companies developing innovative health technologies, alongside AI, cybersecurity, gaming and defence tech start-ups.

""The whole place is really based on community,"" says Maria 01's CEO Sarita Runeberg. ""We bring people together so they can network… and find different kinds of resources to grow their businesses.""

There are also office perks including a pool table, table football, running and ice bathing clubs, and in true Finnish-style, a sauna.

""We wouldn't be a proper start-up hub if we didn't have our own sauna here!"" laughs Ms Runeberg.

While co-working spaces for tech companies are well established across the Nordics, Maria 01 is the largest of its kind in the region.

It is run as a not-for-profit organisation partly funded by the city of Helsinki, which has invested more than €6m ($6.7m; £5.2m) in the hub since its launch in 2016.

Ms Runeberg believes it will become the biggest start-up campus in Europe following the completion of three new buildings by 2028, adding a 50,000 sqm floor area.

Later this year it is launching an accelerator programme designed to support and guide high-growth start-ups.



The hub's current and former members have already collectively raised over €1bn in funding.

This represents around 40% of all early stage funding raised annually by Finnish start-ups.

Ruben Byron is the Belgian co-founder of a start-up offering cloud services to AI developers.

He has already scaled his business from a handful of staff using the hub's hot desks to a team of around 40 working from private offices in the former hospital, as well as remotely.

""That has been a great experience, that we've kind of been able [to] be nurtured here in a way,"" he says.

Although not as mature – or well known globally – as other European start-up hubs like Sweden and the UK, Finland has been steadily making a name for itself in the tech scene over the last two decades.

The small Nordic nation, which has a population of around 5.6 million, has spawned 12 unicorn businesses – firms worth a billion dollars or more – including sleep and fitness tracking ring Oura, game developers Supercell, Rovio (the creators of the Angry Birds game), and food delivery platform Wolt.

Last year, Startup Blink, a global index mapping more than 100 countriesranked Finland's start-up ecosystemthe 7th best in western Europe, and 14th in the world.

The index cites factors including hubs like Maria 01, alongside high levels of state and university support, and Slush - a huge annual non-profit gathering for global start-ups and investors.

It also highlights Finland's transparent and open business culture.

""There is an authenticity with the Finns,"" says Jack Parker, a Helsinki-based founder originally from Newcastle upon Tyne, who runs a healthcare innovation start-up.

""Ego doesn't really play a part. So if I reach out to somebody, it's quite likely eight out of 10 times that they will respond.""

Finland's right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2023, is on a mission to push the country even further up global indices, stating in itsofficial government programmethat it wants the Nordic nation to become a leader in fostering a dynamic start-up and growth company ecosystem.

""It's not just about rankings,"" says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation.

In 2024 Business Finland aloneinvested €112m in start-ups, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year.

""The real goal is to create an environment where our ground-breaking start-ups can emerge and really tackle global challenges.""

The agency hopes this will help drive growth in the Finnish economy, which went into recession in 2023 and is currently making a sluggish recovery, with theBank of Finland forecastingan increase of less than 1% this year.

The country is also trying to attract more global talent by offering start-up permits for international founders who want to grow their businesses in Finland.

These entrepreneurs are eligible for a so-called soft-landing support package provided by Business Finland.

""They give you advice, support, sometimes grants to support the initiation phase,"" explains Lalin Keyvan, a Turkish-born entrepreneur at Maria 01 who says the scheme was one of the main reasons why she relocated to Helsinki.

Business Finland's marketing campaigns for would-be movers highlight social and lifestyle factors too: Finns tend to prioritise wellbeing, plus there's free education and subsidised healthcare and childcare.

""You don't really have to choose between building a high-growth company and enjoying life, because you can do both,"" says Ms Ilmari.

But whether all this is enough for Finland to compete with Europe's more established start-up hubs is up for debate.

Data suggests it still has a long way to go to catch up with neighbouring Sweden, long the Nordic darling of the European start-up scene.

It is home tomore than 40 unicorn businessesincluding Spotify, payments platform Klarna and game developer King.

In Startup Blink's ecosystem ranking Sweden ranks second in Europe after the UK, and top in the EU.

In the last decade it has attracted more than $29bn in funding compared to just over $8bn in Finland, according to the annualState of European Tech reportby investment company Atomico.

""I love Finland's bold approach,"" says Charlotte Ekelund, deputy CEO of Sting, a non-profit organisation that helps develop start-ups in Stockholm. However she believes Finland is still years behind Sweden in terms of pulling in capital and developing its ecosystem.

""We observe some of the things that the Finnish ecosystem is doing now, Sting was part of driving 10 or 15 years ago here - co-working spaces, [and] new organisations in the ecosystem that can support in different ways.""

Mikael Pentikainen, CEO of the Federation of Finnish Enterprises, says the country's government is currently losing support amongst entrepreneurs despite its pro-start-up and pro-business approach.

A recent survey for the organisationfound 41% of small and medium-sized business owners are satisfied with the coalition's actions, down from 54% in June.

One likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25.5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government saidthis was a ""difficult but necessary""move designed to stabilise public finances.

But Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland's start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders.

The Finnish government has also recently toughened up citizenship requirements, meaning foreign entrepreneurs now need to stay at least eight years instead of five in order to obtain a passport, and will soon also be required topass a test on Finnish societyand culture if they want to settle long-term.

Back at Maria 01, Mr Parker, the health company founder, says he's confident Finland's start-up ecosystem will continue to expand and attract international talent. But he warns it might lose some of the aspects that have so far made it an attractive option for entrepreneurs.

""The advantage of the ecosystem right now is this kind of 'small town, everybody knows each other' [feeling]. Scaling that up, there is the risk of actually losing that element of it.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx28y8jj4lxo
A revolution is under way in India's trainer industry,India wants to boost the domestic trainer industry but will small domestic makers suffer?,Asia,"World of Business, International Business, Trainers, India, Technology of Business",Priti Gupta,2025-04-07T23:10:42.249Z,2025-04-08T01:51:32.165Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3100/live/90b206a0-04c5-11f0-8acd-09ec89d7a0aa.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3100/live/90b206a0-04c5-11f0-8acd-09ec89d7a0aa.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nplgm2kpo,"It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products.

Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.

So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.

Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.

The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: ""The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,"" he explains.

""There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,"" Mr Panaruna added.

The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.

To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.

Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.

""These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,"" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.

But many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands.

Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector.

Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market.

Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra.

""Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,"" he says.

""Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.""

So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?

""It's complicated,"" says Mr Sharma.

""I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.

""What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.""

Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector iswell-known formaking counterfeit shoes of big brands.

While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countrieshave long-complainedabout the losses caused.

Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class.

Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement.

Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.

""There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.

""And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.""

Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate.

It claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing.

""This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,"" says founder Utkarsh Gupta.

He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads.

""Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,"" he says.

Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. ""The shift to high value is now happening.""

""Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,"" he adds.

Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.

""The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.""

But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.

""The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly.

""But I don't think the small guys will disappear completely. The smart ones will find their niche.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nplgm2kpo

What's next for social media?,Start-up social media firms are looking to capitalise on dissatisfaction with the social media giants.,N/A,"International business, Social media, Technology, Technology of Business",Shubham Agarwal ,2025-03-28T00:02:06.897Z,2025-03-28T00:02:06.897Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f906/live/b3c4b720-f8d9-11ef-9628-add78e51db09.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f906/live/b3c4b720-f8d9-11ef-9628-add78e51db09.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w1e3xd2glo,"Jay Springett, a tech strategist and podcast host, joined the social media app Butterflies AI out of curiosity, and ended up staying for more than six months.

The idea of Butterflies is to allow human and AI personas to interact.

Mr Springett's online persona developed over time, interacting with other artificial characters, and even went as far as to start its own Beanie Babies [a line of soft toys] collection.

He said it was like AIs were writing their own soap operas inside a simulation.

""I didn't engage with Butterflies in the same way I do with other platforms,"" Mr Springett told BBC.

""It felt more like observing than participating. I wouldn't pay for it, but it was interesting enough to keep watching.""

A host of social media services, like Butterflies, are trying to expand at a time when there is dissatisfaction with the social media giants.

According to data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company, X's daily active users in the UK have dropped by nearly 25% since January 2024.

And it's not just X that has been suffering, mobile and desktop traffic to Facebook has declined over the last few years according to Similarweb.

A reportby the Pew Research Centrefound that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago.

Bluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground.

Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.

Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.

Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.

Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the ""popular with friends"" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.

It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.

He ways it will have to strike a balance between ""generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done"".

Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.

It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (£23m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.

""Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,"" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, ""but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest"".

A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.

The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.

Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.

They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.

Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.

Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.

Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.

It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.

But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.

""One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,"" says Mr Berjon.

At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.

In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.

One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.

Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.

""Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,"" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.

Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.

He hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.

""In the end,"" says Mr McCue, ""it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w1e3xd2glo
The slow but steady advance of driverless vehicles,Robo-taxi services and driverless trucks are gaining ground but progress is painstaking.,N/A,"International business, Alphabet, Driverless cars, Technology of Business, World of Business",Ian Rose,2025-03-21T00:02:48.410Z,2025-03-21T00:02:48.410Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2312/live/c604f050-ffe9-11ef-89b8-6f8a578323da.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2312/live/c604f050-ffe9-11ef-89b8-6f8a578323da.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly41yx9w88o,"Mike Johns didn't expect his return trip from Los Angeles to Scottsdale, Arizona in December to go viral.

To get to the airport he booked a driverless taxi and enjoyed a thrill when he jumped in with curious bystanders looking on.

But he got much more attention than he bargained for.

Mr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on.

The Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch.

Mr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers.

""Why is this happening to me on a Monday morning?"" Mr Johns filmed himself asking.

Eventually a voice activated inside the car telling him to access the Waymo app to get the vehicle back under control.

Waymo which is owned by Alphabet, the parent company of Google, told the BBC that it released a software update almost immediately fixing the problem.

The company says its driverless system is ""better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports"".

Nevertheless, Mr John's experience is not the first time the company has had to take action.

Last year the company recalled more than 600 cars after one hit a street pole.

And in May 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)launched a probeinto 22 incidents involving Waymo vehicles .

The road to a driverless future has also gone awry for rival services.

In December, US car giant General Motorsclosed down its self-drivingcar subsidiary Cruise.

GM attributed the change of strategy to ""the considerable time and resources that would be needed to scale the business"".

In October 2023, one of its vehicles hit a pedestrian and dragged her for more than 20ft (6m), leaving her seriously injured.

Meanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-drivingcar project was folding.

Uber abandoned its owndriverless car efforts in 2020.

But some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla.

Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.

So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?

""Three things - people, money and process,"" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.

He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.

""They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.""

So what's next?

Regions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey.

That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.

""Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,"" Mr Kampshoff says.

He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.

""Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,"" he says.

It will be a slow process.

""It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,"" says Mr Beiker.

""You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,"" he adds.

And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns.

""This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,"" says Mr Kampshoff.

For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.

""Safety is the number one concern that we work on,"" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.

""Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,"" says Mr Liu.

""Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,"" Mr Liu explains.

""A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.

""So we do need to put in different set of technology to be able to see more clearly around the trucks and be able to handle a longer braking distance, for instance.""

To see into the driverless future it might be worth watching developments in China.

In the city of Wuhan more than 500 driverless cars are being operated by the company Baidu.

Across the country driverless cars are reported to be operating in 16 cities and being tested by 19 manufacturers.

""There's definitely more competition... there are four or five companies that are very similar to Waymo,"" says Mr Beiker who is currently working on a study of robo-taxi deployments around the world, sponsored by Sweden's innovation agency Vinnova.

Back in Scottsdale, Mr Johns reflects on his experience and the rollout of autonomous vehicles.

""One big thing is that we're all a part of a paid experiment. At the end of the day, what they're doing is fixing it as they go, per city. And that's a problem.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly41yx9w88o
Disasters spur investment in flood and fire risk tech,"Services that assess climate change risks are springing up for home buyers, insurers and lenders.",N/A,"International Business, Climate, Technology of Business",Suzanne Bearne,2025-03-18T00:08:03.836Z,2025-03-18T00:08:03.836Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e4e2/live/d7e9b470-0306-11f0-96e1-cb441fdfcce2.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e4e2/live/d7e9b470-0306-11f0-96e1-cb441fdfcce2.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd39klk2ppo,"When Storm Babet hit the town of Trowell in Nottingham in 2023, Claire Sneddon felt confident her home would not be affected.

After all, when she bought the property in 2021, she was told by the estate agent that a previous flood the year before, which had reached but not affected the property, was a once-in-a-lifetime event, and that flooding measures to protect the properties on the cul-de-sac would be put in place.

However, when Storm Babet tore through the UK two years later, Ms Sneddon's home flooded after several days of rain.

""We knew there would be water on the cul-de-sac but no one expected it to flood internally again. However, water entered the property for five hours,"" she says.

""It reached to the top of the skirting boards. We had to have all the flooring, woodwork and lower kitchen replaced, which took nearly 12 months.""

Their final insurance bill was around £45,000.

She says they were fortunate to have qualified for a government scheme providing affordable insurance for homeowners in areas of high-flood risk.

Although she loves the area, her neighbours and the house, the weather is now a cause of stress. ""We constantly worry about the weather, if it is going to rain longer than a couple of days, or there is a named storm.

""We do wish we had taken more steps to understand the risk. The survey showed that the property was in a medium flood zone, but there wasn't much detail other than flood zone maps.""

Climate change isincreasing the likelihoodand intensity of natural disasters such as floods, wildfires and hurricanes.

While it might be too late for Ms Sneddon and other homeowners, new tools are being developed to help people and companies assess climate risk.

Last December, the UK Environment Agency updated its National Flood Risk Assessment (NaFRA), showing current and future flood risk from rivers, the sea and surface water for England.

It used its own data alongside that of local authorities and climate data from the Met Office.

It also brought up to date the National Coastal Erosion Risk Map (NCERM). They were both last updated in 2018 and 2017 respectively.

The new NaFRA data shows as many as 6.3 million properties in England are in areas at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea or surface water, and with climate change this could increase to around eight million by 2050.

""We have spent the last few years transforming our understanding of flood and coastal erosion risk in England, drawing on the best available data... as well as improved modelling and technological advances,"" says Julie Foley, director of flood risk strategy at the Environment Agency.

""When we account for the latest climate projections, one in four properties could be in areas at risk of flooding by the middle of the century.""

The Environment Agency plansto launch a portalwhere users can check their long-term flood risk.

Similar resources exist for Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales through the ABI.

""We can no longer rely on historical data,"" says Lukky Ahmed, co-founder of Climate X.

The London-based climate risk firm offers a digital twin of the Earth, which simulates different extreme weather events and their potential impact on properties, infrastructure and assets under different emissions scenarios.

It combines artificial intelligence with physics-based climate models.

""While many climate models might tell you how much rainfall to expect, they don't say what happens when that water hits the ground,"" he says.

""Our models simulate, for example, what happens when the water hits, where it travels and what the impact of the flooding will be.""

While banks and other lenders are testing their product, property companies are currently using their services when considering new developments.

""They log into our platform and identify locations and existing building stock and in return they receive risk rating and severity metrics tied to hazards,"" says Mr Ahmed.

Many parts of the world have much more extreme weather than the UK.

In the US in January, devastating wild fires tore throughparts of Los Angeles. Meanwhile Hurricane Milton, which landed last October, is likely to be one of thecostliest hurricanes to hit west Florida.

To help insurers manage those costs, New York-based Faura analyses the resilience of homes and commercial buildings.

""We look at the different elements of a property to understand how likely it is to survive and pinpoint resilience and survivability of a property,"" says Faura co-founder Valkyrie Holmes.

""We tell companies and homeowners whether their property will still be standing after a disaster, not just whether a disaster will happen in an area,"" he adds.

Faura bases its assessments on satellite and aerial imagery and data from surveys and disaster reports.

""Insurance companies technically have the data to be able to do this but have not build out the models to quantify it,"" says Mr Holmes.

Other services are popping up for homebuyers. For the properties it markets, US firm Redfin, estimates the percentage chance of natural disasters, such as flooding and wildfires, occurring up to the next 30 years across each property.

""If people are looking at two homes with the same layout in the same neighbourhood, then climate risk will make or break [their decision],"" says Redfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather.

As for Ms Sneddon, following her personal experience, she now works for flood risk company The FPS Group.

""Flood risk is only going to get worse over the coming years so it is essential to find out as much as you can about the flood risk to a property,"" she advises.

""Flooding has a huge impact on communities and mental health. You are supposed to feel safe in your home, it shouldn't be a place of worry and anxiety.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjd39klk2ppo
Can AI help modernise Ireland's healthcare system?,Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?,Europe,"Republic of Ireland, International Business, Health, Technology of Business",Padraig Belton,2025-02-28T00:06:40.724Z,2025-02-28T00:06:40.724Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2c37/live/231d9a10-e223-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2c37/live/231d9a10-e223-11ef-a319-fb4e7360c4ec.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7yxm3py5o,"For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.

They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.

In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.

Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.

But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.

That includesa programme called Sláintecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its €22.9bn (£20bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.

To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.

It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.

That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.

""In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,"" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.

Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.

To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: ""We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.""

The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.

""Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,"" he says.

Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.

Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.

Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.

But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a ""synthetic MRI"" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.

That was done by feeding a ""generative AI"" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.

Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.

And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.

Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.

But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.

That will ""severely delay"" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.

Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.

""Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,"" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.

""Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,"" he says.

Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.

An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.

But some have been foundto make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.

To prevent such AI from hallucinating, ""you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,"" says Prof MacMahon.

AIs can have biases, but ""humans have biases too"", he points out.

A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.

""For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error"", than in new health technology where ""the acceptable risk is zero"", says Prof Seán Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.

This means we ""continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans"", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.

Healthcare regulators, who already have a ""weak enough"" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.

For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.

But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. ""For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,"" he points out.

AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.

That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.

When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to ""be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,"" he says.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7yxm3py5o
Countries compete to keep skilled young workers,"EU nations hope that tax benefits might encourage young, skilled workers to stay, but will they work?",Europe,"Software, International Business, Portugal, Technology of Business",Pedro Garcia,2025-02-25T00:03:56.588Z,2025-02-25T00:03:56.588Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7be1/live/f481b5b0-be05-11ef-97a7-0ff098912783.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7be1/live/f481b5b0-be05-11ef-97a7-0ff098912783.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj30xr1vy2lo,"In 2020, Duarte Dias, a Portuguese software engineer, accepted a job offer to work in Microsoft's Dublin subsidiary.

A little over a year later, he joined a team at Microsoft's headquarters in Seattle, where he still works.

Even though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career.

Mr Dias's decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving.

The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous.

""I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldn't be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level,"" says.

A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbon's Instituto Superior Técnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to €35,000 ($36,000; £29,000).

But his take home salary was much, much less.

His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state.

""Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,"" he recalls.

Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to €60,000.

The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home.

Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with ""with many more savings"".

Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments.

In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education.

In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data.

After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels.

The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance.

But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad.

""It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under €28,000,"" says Sérgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Católica Lisbon School of Law.

He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations.

Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal.

That'sthe 8th highest amongthe 38 member countries of the OECD.

""This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,"" adds Mr Vasques.

Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: ""I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year.

""Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime"".

Rita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration.

According to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages.

""The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,"" she said.

Ms de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to ""leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return.""

Antonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad.

""Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of €1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me €4,200 for a junior role.""

Even with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. ""It wasn't a difficult decision,"" says Mr Almeida.

Now in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. ""I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons.

""But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes.""

Mr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home.

""Up until today I never thought about it.""

Mr Dias agrees: ""Salaries outside Portugal will always be higher, and all those who don't have any personal or familial connections to the country won't have any kind of financial or career incentive to stay there"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj30xr1vy2lo
Will quantum computers disrupt critical infrastructure?,Quantum computers will be able to crack existing encryption and threaten critical infrastructure.,N/A,"International Business, Technology of Business, Quantum computing, Cyber-security",Joe Fay,2025-02-21T00:39:57.619Z,2025-02-21T00:40:04.810Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/defa/live/4b76c4e0-bd21-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/defa/live/4b76c4e0-bd21-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq9zxxn72qo,"Twenty five years ago computer programmers were racing to fix the millennium bug amidst fears that it would cause banking systems to crash and planes to fall out of the sky.

Much to everyone's reliefthe impact turned out to be minimal.

Today, some fear there is a new critical threat to the world’s digital infrastructure. But this time, we cannot predict exactly when it will move from theory to reality, while the ubiquity of digital technology means fixing the problem is even more complicated.

That’s because the arrival of quantum computing means that many of the encryption algorithms that underpin and secure our hyperconnected world will be trivially easy to crack.

Quantum computing is radically different to the “classical” computing used today. Instead of processing binary bits which exist in one of two states – one or zero, on or off – quantum computing uses qubits, which can exist in multiple states, or superpositions.

“The reason why it's so powerful is because you're doing all those possible computations simultaneously,” Prof Nishanth Sastry, director of research for computer science at the University of Surrey, explains. This means it's “much, much more efficient, much, much more powerful.”

This means quantum systems offer the possibility of solving key problems that are beyond classical computers, is areas such as medical research and materials science, or cracking particularly complex mathematical problems.

The problem is some of those same mathematical problems underpin the encryption algorithms that help to ensure trust, confidentiality and privacy across today’s computer networks.

Today’s computers would take thousands, even millions of years, to crack current encryption standards, such as RSA. A suitably powerful quantum computer could, theoretically, do the job in minutes.

This has implications for everything from electronic payments and ecommerce to satellite communications. “Anything that's protected by something that's vulnerable becomes fair game for people that have access to quantum relevant computers,” says Jon France, chief information security officer at non-profit cybersecurity organization ISC2.

Quantum computers capable of breaking asymmetric encryption are thought to be years away.

But progress is being made.

In December,Google said its new quantum chipincorporates key ""breakthroughs"" and ""paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer"".

Some estimates say a quantum device capable of breaking current encryption would require 10,000 qubits, while others say millions would be needed. Today’s systems have a few hundred at most.

But businesses and governments face a problem right now, as attackers could harvest encrypted information and decrypt it later when they do gain access to suitably powerful devices.

Greg Wetmore, vice president for software development at security firm Entrust, says if such devices could emerge in the next decade, technology leaders need to ask, “What data in your organization is valuable for that period of time?”

That could be national security information, personal data, strategic plans, and intellectual property and secrets - think of a soft drink company’s “secret” formula or the precise balance of herbs and spices in a fast food recipe.

Mr France adds, if quantum computing becomes widespread, the threat becomes more immediate with the encryption that protects our daily banking transactions, for example, potentially trivial to break.

The good news is that researchers and the technology industry have been working on solutions to the problem. In August, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the US released three post quantum encryption standards.

The agency said these would “secure a wide range of electronic information, from confidential email messages to e-commerce transactions that propel the modern economy.” It is encouraging computer system administrators to transition to the new standards as soon as possible, and said a further 18 algorithms are being evaluated as backup standards.

The problem is this means a massive upgrade process touching virtually all our technology infrastructure.

“If you think about the number of things out there with asymmetric encryption in them, it's billions of things. We're facing a really big change problem,” says Mr France.

Some digital infrastructure will be relatively easy to upgrade. Your browser, for example, will simply receive an update from the vendor says Mr France. “The challenge really comes in discrete devices and the internet of things (IOT),” he continues.

These might be hard to track down, and geographically inaccessible. Some equipment – legacy devices in critical national infrastructure such as water systems, for example – might not be powerful enough to handle the new encryption standards.

Mr Wetmore says the industry has managed encryption transitions in the past, but “It's the sharper discontinuity that makes this threat more serious.”

So, it is trying to help customers build “crypto agility” by setting out policies now and using automation to identify and manage their cryptographic assets. “That's the secret to making this transition an orderly one and not a chaotic one.”

And the challenge extends into space. Prof Sastry says many satellites – such as the Starlink network – should be relatively straightforward to upgrade, even if it means briefly taking an individual device offline temporarily.

“At any given point in time, especially with the LEO (low earth orbit) satellites, you've got 10 to 20 satellites above your head,” Prof Sastry says. “So, if one can't serve you, well so what? There are nine others that can serve you.”

More challenging, he says, are “remote sensing” satellites, which include those used for geographical or intelligence purposes. These carry a lot more compute power on board and typically include some sort of secure computing module. A hardware upgrade effectively means replacing the whole device. However, says Prof Sastry, this is now less of a problem thanks to more frequent and lower cost satellite launches.

While the impact of the millennium bug might have been minimal in the first days of 2000, that's because an immense amount of work had gone into fixing it ahead of a known deadline, says François Dupressoir, associate professor in cryptography at the University of Bristol.

By contrast, he adds, that it is not possible to predict when current encryption will become vulnerable.

""With cryptography,"" says Mr Dupressoir ""If somebody breaks your system, you will only know once they've got your data.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq9zxxn72qo
India hair: 'It’s just thrown away but it's gold',India is the world's biggest exporter of human hair but it wants more of the lucrative wig market.,N/A,"International Business, Technology of Business",Priti Gupta,2025-02-17T22:27:15.022Z,2025-02-17T22:27:15.022Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ada8/live/713468a0-ed63-11ef-bd1b-d536627785f2.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ada8/live/713468a0-ed63-11ef-bd1b-d536627785f2.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dl93l7w2go,"Zeeshan Ali has been a drag artist for 10 years and has taken his show all over India.

Central to his performance is a collection of around 45 wigs.

“It’s an alter of identity, helping me transition from my everyday self into exaggerated, glamorous or whimsical characters. The right wig makes me feel more authentic and empowers me to command the stage,"" says Ali, who is based in Mumbai.

But getting that look right wasn't easy in the early days.

""When I started my career the accessibility of the wigs was extremely difficult in India. Most of them were to be sourced from abroad or I used to make wigs sourced from whatever was available to me like wool, fabric,"" he says.

But things are different now.

“The trend is changing. Wigs are no longer just meant for drag or movie artists, but many straight women wear wigs to look different. It's no longer just a hair accessory but a style statement.”

Indian hair has always been in demand for wig-making. The nation is the world's biggest exporter of human hair, supplying 85% of global demand.

Kolachi Venkatesh, based in Avadi, Chennai, has been collecting hair for 20 years. He started at the bottom of the industry as a picker - collecting hair from households and rescuing it from the rubbish.

“My parents were hair pickers and then I started doing the same,"" he says.

Hair collected by pickers from homes, salons and barbershops is called non-Remy hair.

It requires more processing than Remy hair, which is carefully shaved straight from the scalp. Nevertheless, it has value.

""It’s just thrown away but it's gold,"" says Mr Venkatesh.

Those pickers typically sell hair to local traders like Mr Venkatesh for between 10 cents and $1 (£0.80) per kilogram, depending on the quality and length of the hair.

Shorter or damaged hair fetches less, while longer strands bring higher prices.

For the individual picker, there's not much money in it.

“A diligent collector might gather 1–5 kilograms of hair in a day, earning anywhere from 59 cents to $6 per day. This income level is often below minimum wage standards, particularly in rural areas,” says Mr Venkatesh, who has 50 pickers working for him.

“While our work contributes to a billion-dollar global market our earnings remain meagre. Intermediaries control prices.”

Most of the Indian hair collected by traders like Mr Venkatesh is exported to China where it is made into wigs.

“China has a huge wigmaking industry which is worth five to six billion dollars,"" says Benjamin Cherian from Plexconcil, the hair industry body that promotes the Indian industry and liaises with the government.

If India wants a slice of the lucrative wig market, he says, then it has a lot of catching up to do.

""When we look at China there are hundreds of factories spread across the country which add value to the hair industry, whereas in India the value addition still needs to be picked up,” Mr Cherian says.

He says the government needs to help promote investment in the hair industry.

""It needs automated sorting systems, sophisticated hair treatment procedures for the hair collected, innovative production techniques for manufacturing of wigs which will make India stand out.”

Instead of exporting hair for hundreds of dollars, India should be selling wigs worth thousands of dollars says Mr Cherian.

“We have started working on it but it’s a long way to go. We need to have research and training centres,"" he says.

One Indian business trying to make inroads is Delhi-based Diva Divine Hair, co-founded by Krishan Jalani in 2019.

It is currently managed by chief executive and co-founder Nidhi Tiwari.

The idea was to create high-quality hair extensions and wigs that would appeal to a broader range of customers.

""There is a growing need for these solutions due to rising issues of hair loss and thinning among women in India,"" says Ms Tiwari.

The company has been helped by a shift in attitude.

""Once considered a niche or taboo topic, wigs and extensions are now openly discussed, thanks to evolving social norms and a shift toward acceptance,"" she says.

Wigs have also seen a lot of development making them more attractive and comfortable.

""Technologies such as 3D-printed wigs and digital colour-matching tools offer highly personalised options. Lightweight, breathable wig caps and improved adhesives have given customers to wear it for long time without discomfort,"" says Ms Tiwari.

At the top end of the hair market is Temple or Remy hair.

Much of the supply comes from Hindu temples in the south of the country where hair is shaved off in an act of veneration and faith.

Raj Hair International is one of the biggest traders in the Temple hair business.

Craftsmen at the company's Chennai factory sort and grade the hair according to colour, texture and length.

""Remy hair has aligned cuticles, hair flows uniformly in one direction, which leads to less tangling and a silkier texture. This is high-value hair,"" says George Cherion, the company's chief executive.

The firm tries to waste as little of the hair as possible. To help with that it developed a machine to untangle the hair. It's allowed them to work faster with fewer staff.

""Our mission is to constantly upgrade the technology,"" says Mr Cherion.

Business is booming.

""Indian human is in demand globally due to its high quality, natural look, and thinness. The demand is skyrocketing,"" he says.

Back in Mumbai Zeeshan Ali wants to see more Indian wigs on the market.

As well as making them more affordable, he has a design suggestion: ""A wig that can create a wow factor.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dl93l7w2go
Why do kindness influencers get criticised?,Kindness influencers give away money and gifts but not everyone supports their work.,N/A,"International Business, Technology of Business",Suzanne Bearne,2025-02-11T00:31:41.049Z,2025-02-11T00:31:41.049Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4810/live/45f50d00-d31b-11ef-9fd6-0be88a764111.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4810/live/45f50d00-d31b-11ef-9fd6-0be88a764111.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23v3kxknrno,"Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied.

The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.

""It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,"" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.

The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.

""I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,"" he says.

Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.

Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut.

""Kindness is cool,"" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.

Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money.

""I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story… and often the people who have the least give the most,"" says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers.

Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.

The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?

Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.

""Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.""

On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?

""""While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,"" says Ms Cleary.

Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.

""I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,"" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.

She explains that the videos often involve someone being identified as ""in need"". They are then asked for a favour. It might be spare money for a bus fare or help with something.

She argues the participant is being ""lured"" into valuing the needs of someone else, who appears richer, more highly than their own.

Only if they do that are they rewarded.

""I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,"" asks Ms Burke.

The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.

""I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,"" says Mr Weidenhofer.

And how about filming people without their consent?

""If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,"" says Mr Weidenhofer.

But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him ""feel weird"".

Sometimes large amounts of money are given to vulnerable people, which they might not be in a position to manage.

Mr Dereniowski realised that this might be an issue when he raised $240,000 overnight for a father and son who were living in their car.

After that, more thought goes into longer term help.

""We've started setting up financial advisors. We've started getting these people jobs. We've helped allocate the funds properly to pay off their debt, their car, helping them get a home and [pay their] rent,"" he says.

Why employees smuggle AI into work,Many staff are using AI at work without the permission of their employers.,N/A,"International Business, Artificial intelligence, Technology of Business",Sean McManus,2025-02-04T00:08:33.720Z,2025-02-04T00:08:33.720Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f289/live/101ef570-b93e-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f289/live/101ef570-b93e-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7rx05xg2go,"""It's easier to get forgiveness than permission,"" says John, a software engineer at a financial services technology company. ""Just get on with it. And if you get in trouble later, then clear it up.""

He's one of the many people who are using their own AI tools at work, without the permission of their IT division (which is why we are not using John's full name).

According to a surveyby Software AG, half of all knowledge workers use personal AI tools.

The research defines knowledge workers as ""those who primarily work at a desk or computer"".

For some it's because their IT team doesn't offer AI tools, while others said they wanted their own choice of tools.

John's company provides GitHub Copilot for AI-supported software development, but he prefers Cursor.

""It's largely a glorified autocomplete, but it is very good,"" he says. ""It completes 15 lines at a time, and then you look over it and say, 'yes, that's what I would've typed'. It frees you up. You feel more fluent.""

His unauthorised use isn't violating a policy, it's just easier than risking a lengthy approvals process, he says. ""I'm too lazy and well paid to chase up the expenses,"" he adds.

John recommends that companies stay flexible in their choice of AI tools. ""I've been telling people at work not to renew team licences for a year at a time because in three months the whole landscape changes,"" he says. ""Everybody's going to want to do something different and will feel trapped by the sunk cost.""

The recent release of DeepSeek, a freely available AI model from China, is only likely to expand the AI options.

Peter (not his real name) is a product manager at a data storage company, which offers its people the Google Gemini AI chatbot.

External AI tools are banned but Peter uses ChatGPT through search tool Kagi. He finds the biggest benefit of AI comes from challenging his thinking when he asks the chatbot to respond to his plans from different customer perspectives.

""The AI is not so much giving you answers, as giving you a sparring partner,"" he says. ""As a product manager, you have a lot of responsibility and don't have a lot of good outlets to discuss strategy openly. These tools allow that in an unfettered and unlimited capacity.""

The version of ChatGPT he uses (4o) can analyse video. ""You can get summaries of competitors' videos and have a whole conversation [with the AI tool] about the points in the videos and how they overlap with your own products.""

In a 10-minute ChatGPT conversation he can review material that would take two or three hours watching the videos.

He estimates that his increased productivity is equivalent to the company getting a third of an additional person working for free.

He's not sure why the company has banned external AI. ""I think it's a control thing,"" he says. ""Companies want to have a say in what tools their employees use. It's a new frontier of IT and they just want to be conservative.""

The use of unauthorized AI applications is sometimes called 'shadow AI'. It's a more specific version of 'shadow IT', which is when someone uses software or services the IT department hasn't approved.

Harmonic Security helps to identify shadow AI and to prevent corporate data being entered into AI tools inappropriately.

It is tracking more than 10,000 AI apps and has seen more than 5,000 of them in use.

These include custom versions of ChatGPT and business software that has added AI features, such as communications tool Slack.

However popular it is, shadow AI comes with risks.

Modern AI tools are built by digesting huge amounts of information, in a process called training.

Around 30% of the applications Harmonic Security has seen being used train using information entered by the user.

That means the user's information becomes part of the AI tool and could be output to other users in the future.

Companies may be concerned about their trade secrets being exposed by the AI tool's answers, but Alastair Paterson, CEO and co-founder of Harmonic Security, thinks that's unlikely. ""It's pretty hard to get the data straight out of these [AI tools],"" he says.

However, firms will be concerned about their data being stored in AI services they have no control over, no awareness of, and which may be vulnerable to data breaches.

It will be hard for companies to fight against the use of AI tools, as they can be extremely useful, particularly for younger workers.

""[AI] allows you to cram five years' experience into 30 seconds of prompt engineering,"" says Simon Haighton-Williams, CEO at The Adaptavist Group, a UK-based software services group.

""It doesn't wholly replace [experience], but it's a good leg up in the same way that having a good encyclopaedia or a calculator lets you do things that you couldn't have done without those tools.""

What would he say to companies that discover they have shadow AI use?

""Welcome to the club. I think probably everybody does. Be patient and understand what people are using and why, and figure out how you can embrace it and manage it rather than demand it's shut off. You don't want to be left behind as the organization that hasn't [adopted AI].""

Trimble provides software and hardware to manage data about the built environment. To help its employees use AI safely, the company created Trimble Assistant. It's an internal AI tool based on the same AI models that are used in ChatGPT.

Employees can consult Trimble Assistant  for a wide range of applications, including product development, customer support and market research. For software developers, the company provides GitHub Copilot.

Karoliina Torttila is director of AI at Trimble. ""I encourage everybody to go and explore all kinds of tools in their personal life, but recognise that their professional life is a different space and there are some safeguards and considerations there,"" she says.

The company encourages employees to explore new AI models and applications online.

""This brings us to a skill we're all forced to develop: We have to be able to understand what is sensitive data,"" she says.

""There are places where you would not put your medical information and you have to be able to make those type of judgement calls [for work data, too].""

Why leaving X can be a tricky decision for companies,Many companies have left X but it's not always a simple decision.,Technology,"Social media, International Business, Technology of Business",Dan Rosney,2025-01-30T00:18:27.026Z,2025-01-30T00:18:27.026Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7336/live/f7b292c0-d96e-11ef-902e-cf9b84dc1357.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7336/live/f7b292c0-d96e-11ef-902e-cf9b84dc1357.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx9e0y17wwo,"On March 21, 2006 the first ever tweet was posted by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey: ""Just setting up my twttr"". It was a simple introduction to a brand new platform.

Backed by celebrities, it was different to other social media sites, like MySpace or Facebook, because you could interact with any user without them having to approve a request. Companies rushed to join the service, hoping to get closer to their customers.

""If you were a brand that wanted to be part of any cultural moments that were happening, Twitter was a great place to be,"" Alex Wilson, a senior strategist at the marketing agency Pitch tells BBC News.

On June 4, 2010 Elon Musk, the owner of Space X, logged on for the first time: ""Please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me.""

Twelve years laterhe would buy the platformfor $44bn (£38.1bn), reshape the algorithm, reinstate banned accounts, repurpose the policy around ""free speech"", and rename it X.

He also fired thousands of staff - around 80% of the workforce.

Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed ""the great X-odus"".

One of their main concerns was the content that would be seen around their posts that users could screengrab and share.

For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled,according to researchby the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.

More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.

In particular, his posts onthe subject of grooming gangsput pressure on the government, whichannounced a review of the issue.

""There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,"" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News.

However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, andhis approval ratingwith the British public sits at -35.

The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well.

At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disneypaused advertisement on the platform.

Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them ofunlawfully agreeingto boycott the site.

""It's broadly fair to say Twitter is becoming less relevant across the world,"" Mr Wilson says in the Pitch office in central London, with posters of clients ranging from charities, telecommunications, and sports leagues.

""It's been a very long time since clients came to us and say: 'Twitter's fun and exciting. We want to be in that space'.

""Unless you are targeting specific audiences, maybe certain political audiences or sports  - football is still big on Twitter - it's hard to see the value in it.""

Trump's election victory has prompted other organisations to leave X, with others considering their positions as Mr Musk's influence in the White House grows.

Beginning in 2013, German football team FC St Pauli, which plays in Germany's top league, the Bundesliga, posted more than 60,000 times, racking up nearly 250,000 followers.

But less than 10 days after Trump's return to the White House was confirmed, the club posted: ""You can find our statement about saying goodbye to X on BlueSky. Feel free to follow us there. We're out of here.""

""We discussed the decision for a year. We were mostly posting content with counter speech to hate. We had a lot of content for diversity, anti-racism, and anti-sexism,"" club spokesperson, Patrick Gensing told the BBC.

""We have seen assaults on X, antisemitism, conspiracy theories,"" he says.

The argument that such posts are justified by freedom of speech, does not convince him.

""We don't think racism is freedom of speech,"" says Mr Gensing.

One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it wasno longer posting on Xand directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram.

There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform.

When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its ""purpose is to serve the public conversation"".

Mr Musk ""has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter"", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.

But leaving X can have negative consequences for organisations and their relationships with customers.

""When users leave, the impact depends on who is leaving and why. A local authority posting news provides significant value to the network. If such an account leaves, it can hurt both the platform and its users,"" he tells BBC News.

""Users protesting by leaving should weigh the broader social implications of staying versus exiting.""

For some organisations who need to get their message out quickly, X still has value that other competitors simply can't offer.

""For us there is still that value [on being on X],"" says Andrew Cassidy, senior director of digital strategy and engagement at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).

""We try to match where our riders are. When people are tweeting at the MBTA someone can provide a definitive answer in the moment. Our broadcasting system is exclusively tied into our X account, but we still field customer service questions across other platforms.""

""Our focus is providing customer service to the largest number of riders that we possibly can,"" Mr Cassidy says.

""With the current landscape being what it is, X still feeds that need.""

It's ""unthinkable"", Mr Gensing explains, not to have a presence on social media in 2025.

""We have to view all the platforms critically, it's not only X. The companies behind them set up the rules of the game and they can change them.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqx9e0y17wwo
Will young developers take on key open source software?,"The founders of important open source software are getting older, who will take over?",N/A,"Software, International Business, Technology of Business",Joe Fay,2025-01-28T00:01:05.997Z,2025-01-28T00:01:05.997Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/eedf/live/63765190-b160-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/eedf/live/63765190-b160-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7n2jm5m5o,"Many of us have prepared instructions and critical information for our family in the event of our sudden demise. For Daniel Stenberg, that includes passwords for his Google and GitHub accounts.

That’s because he’s the founder of curl, an open source internet transfer engine that has been downloaded billions of times and is used to transfer data to and from computer servers.

It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions every day.

It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.

“I just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,” Mr Stenberg says.

It’s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system – and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.

The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today’s technology landscape.

In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master’s thesis. “My concern was graduating,” he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.

Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.

“We're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,” he says.

While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That’s not just because they’ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.

But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.

Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.

Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the “kernel maintainers are aging”.

Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK’s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.

“You've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.”

There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.

While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. “The fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.”

There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on “plug-ins”, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.

Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the “Rust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.”

When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.

Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. “I'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,” he says.

And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.

Miss Brock says it’s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.

This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it’s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.

“It's a way to help STEM talent flight,” Miss Brock adds. “Because people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they’re in.”

Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there’s “probably less visceral enthusiasm” for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.

And, he continues, “I've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.”

Ultimately, he says, there is a “joy, especially for a young person” in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.

“That feeling doesn't get old,” he says. Even if the pioneers who popularized the earliest open source projects do.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7n2jm5m5o
GPs turn to AI to help with patient workload,Should more AI be used to help GPs with consultations and administrative work?,Technology,"International Business, Doctors, Artificial intelligence, Healthcare, NHS, Technology of Business, General practitioners (GPs)",Suzanne Bearne,2025-01-14T00:09:07.283Z,2025-01-14T00:09:07.283Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/49a8/live/df0146c0-9cf8-11ef-9d47-3962c94c3bbb.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/49a8/live/df0146c0-9cf8-11ef-9d47-3962c94c3bbb.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd026lgmdmo,"This is the fifth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.

The difficulty of getting an appointment with a GP is a familiar gripe in the UK.

Even when an appointment is secured,the rising workload faced by doctorsmeans those meetings can be shorter than either the doctor or patient would like.

But Dr Deepali Misra-Sharp, a GP partner in Birmingham, has found that AI has alleviated a chunk of the administration from her job, meaning she can focus more on patients.

Dr Mirsa-Sharp started using Heidi Health, a free AI-assisted medical transcription tool that listens and transcribes patient appointments, about four months ago and says it has made a big difference.

“Usually when I’m with a patient, I am writing things down and it takes away from the consultation,” she says. “This now means I can spend my entire time locking eyes with the patient and actively listening. It makes for a more quality consultation.”

She says the tech reduces her workflow, saving her “two to three minutes per consultation, if not more”. She reels off other benefits: “It reduces the risk of errors and omissions in my medical note taking.""

With a workforce in decline while the number of patients continues to grow, GPs face immense pressure.

A single full-time GP is now responsible for 2,273 patients, up 17% since September 2015,according to the British Medical Association (BMA).

Could AI be the solution to help GP’s cut back on administrative tasks and alleviate burnout?

Some research suggests it could.A 2019 reportprepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.

Meanwhile,research by Oxford Universityin 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.

One company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.

Corti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.

“The idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,” says Lars Maaløe, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.

“The AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,” says Mr Maaløe.

“I imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It’s giving that colleague advice.”

He also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. “It could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?”

But do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?

Mr Maaløe says “the data is not leaving system”. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.

“If the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.”

Dr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. “I haven’t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn’t do it.”

Meanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients’ medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.

“It can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there’s any relevant information from their medical history,” says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.

The AI is trained on published medical research papers.

“For example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,” says Dr Bakshi. “It won’t diagnose, but it can facilitate.”

She says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.

An AI report published by the BMA this year found that “AI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency”.

In a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: ""We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not enacted safely, it could also cause considerable harm. AI is subject to bias and error, can potentially compromise patient privacy and is still very much a work-in-progress.

""Whilst AI can be used to enhance and supplement what a GP can offer as another tool in their arsenal, it's not a silver bullet. We cannot wait on the promise of AI tomorrow, to deliver the much-needed productivity, consistency and safety improvements needed today.”

Alison Dennis, partner and co-head of law firm Taylor Wessing's international life sciences team, warns that GPs need to tread carefully when using AI.

""There is the very high risk of generative AI tools not providing full and complete, or correct diagnoses or treatment pathways, and even giving wrong diagnoses or treatment pathways i.e. producing hallucinations or basing outputs on clinically incorrect training data,” says Ms Dennis.

“AI tools that have been trained on reliable data sets and then fully validated for clinical use – which will almost certainly be a specific clinical use, are more suitable in clinical practice.”

She says specialist medical products must be regulated and receive some form of official accreditation.

“The NHS would also want to ensure that all data that is inputted into the tool is retained securely within the NHS system infrastructure, and is not absorbed for further use by the provider of the tool as training data without the appropriate GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] safeguards in place.""

For now, for GPs like Misra-Sharp, it has transformed their work. “It has made me go back to enjoying my consultations again instead of feeling time pressured.”",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdd026lgmdmo
How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases,Pharmaceutical firms are turning to AI to find new molecules that might be able to tackle disease.,N/A,"Medicine, International Business, Artificial intelligence, Technology of Business",Zoe Corbyn,2025-01-10T00:17:34.766Z,2025-01-10T00:17:34.766Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cbcd/live/ce9829b0-bc57-11ef-a278-abc31536c8b8.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/cbcd/live/ce9829b0-bc57-11ef-a278-abc31536c8b8.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6lg44jwwno,"This is the fourth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.

Over a video call, Alex Zhavoronkov holds up a small, green, diamond-shaped pill.

It has been developed by his company to treat a rare progressive lung disease for which there is no known cause or cure.

The new drug has yet to be approved, but in small clinical trials hasshown impressive efficacyin treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

It's one of a new wave of drugs where artificial intelligence (AI) has been integral to its discovery.

""We can't say we have the first AI discovered and designed molecule approved,"" says Dr Zhavoronkov, the co-founder and CEO of US-based start-up Insilico Medicine. ""But we may be the furthest along the path.""

Welcome to the great AI drug race, where a host of companies are employing the power of AI to do what has traditionally been the job of medicinal chemists.

That includes both smaller, specialist AI-driven biotech companies, which have sprung up over the past decade, and larger pharmaceutical firms who are either doing the research themselves, or in partnership with smaller firms.

Among the newer players is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which launched UK-based AI drug discovery company Isomorphic Labs, in late 2021.

Its CEO, Demis Hassabis, shared this year's Nobel prize in chemistry for an AI model that is expected to be useful for AI drug design.

Using AI to do drug discovery could make an ""enormous difference"" for patients, says Chris Meier, of the Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Bringing a new drug to market takes on average 10 to 15 years, and costs more than $2bn (£1.6bn).

It's also risky:about 90% of drugsthat go into clinical trials fail. The hope is that using AI for the drug discovery part of that process could cut the time and cost, and result in more success.

A new era, where AI is at the centre of the drug discovery process is emerging, says Charlotte Deane, a professor of structural bioinformatics at Oxford University, who develops freely available AI tools to help pharmaceutical companies and others improve their drug discovery.

""We are at the beginning of just how good that might be,"" she says.

It is unlikely to lead to fewer pharmaceutical scientists, say experts - the real savings will come if there are fewer failures - but it will mean working in partnership with AI.

A recently published analysisby BCG found at least 75 ""AI-discovered molecules"" have entered clinical trials with many more expected.

""That they are now routinely going into clinical trials is a major milestone,"" says Dr Meier. The next – and ""even bigger milestone"" – will be when they start to come out the other end.

However, Prof Deane notes that there is no definition yet of what exactly counts as an ""AI discovered"" drug and, in all the examples to date, there has still been lots of human involvement.

There are two steps within the drug discovery process where AI is being most heavily deployed explains Dr Meier.

The first is in identifying, at the molecular level, the therapeutic target that it is intended the drug will act to correct, such as a certain gene or protein being altered by the disease in a way it shouldn't.

While traditionally scientists test potential targets in the lab experimentally, based on what they understand of a disease, AI can be trained to mine large databases to make connections between the underlying molecular biology and the disease and make suggestions.

The second, and more common, is in designing the drug to correct the target.

This employs generative AI, also the basis of ChatGPT, to imagine molecules that might bind to the target and work, replacing the expensive manual process of chemists synthesising many hundreds of variations of the same molecule and trying them to find the optimal one.

Insilico Medicine, founded in 2014 and which has received more than $425m in funding, used AI for both steps, as well as to predict the probability of success in clinical trials which it then feeds back into its drug discovery work.

Currently the firm has six molecules in clinical trials, including to treat IPF for which the next phase of trials is being planned.

In addition four molecules have been cleared to enter trials, and nearly 30 others are showing promise.

All have been ""discovered from scratch using generative AI"", says Dr Zhavoronkov. ""Our machines dream until they come up with a perfect drug that fits all our criteria.""

The novel molecule to treat IPF was designed by the company's generative AI software after it was given the objective of inhibiting a protein called TNIK, which has never been targeted before for treating IPF, but was suggested by another set of the company's AI software as the most likely regulator of the disease.

Possibilities suggested by the system were then synthesised and tested.

The discovery process was far quicker and leaner than standard for the industry, notes Dr Zhavoronkov.

It took 18 months and required synthesis and testing of 79 molecules, where usually it would be expected to take about four years and at least the synthesis of 500. Other of Insilco's molecules have even lower numbers, he says.

The lack of data from which AI can learn remains the biggest challenge for the field generally, say experts.

That cuts across both target identification and molecule design, and can potentially introduce biases.

US-based Recursion Pharmaceuticals says its approach mitigates the problems of limited data.

Through automated experiments, it generates massive quantities of data related to the entire collection of molecules that makes up the human body. It then trains AI tools to understand that data and find unexpected relationships.

To help to do that,last year it installedwhat it says is the fastest supercomputer owned and operated by any pharmaceutical company.

It has had some success. A molecule developed by the company to treat both lymphoma and solid tumours is now being tested on cancer patients in early-stage clinical trials.

It was developed after the AI spotted a new way of targeting a gene which is thought to be important in driving these cancers, but which nobody had previously cracked how to target on its own.

Recursion co-founder and CEO Chris Gibson says what matters most in the field is something neither Recursion nor anyone else has yet shown: that these AI-discovered molecules can make it through clinical trials and that, over time, they deliver an increased probability of success over traditional methods.

When that happens, says Dr Gibson, ""it'll be obvious to the world that this is the way to go"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz6lg44jwwno
"Miliband urges global cooperation amidst energy ""challenges""",The UK Energy Secretary was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security. ,N/A,"Ed Miliband, Climate, Oil & Gas industry, Renewable energy",Esme Stallard,2025-04-24T10:50:30.532Z,2025-04-24T10:50:30.532Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f908/live/679e2200-20ed-11f0-8451-0101bb35273b.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f908/live/679e2200-20ed-11f0-8451-0101bb35273b.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8kr8k28z2o,"Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.

He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.

Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being ""weaponised"", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.

Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.

In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.

He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.

The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased ""international fragmentation"" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.

""Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.""

He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.

Global gas prices spikedfollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.

Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threatas relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.

The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a ""success"" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.

Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.

""On the big calls – like the future of global oil demand – the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,"" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation

""As countries come together to shape a new energy security paradigm, they need unbiased, dependable data on the future direction of energy,"" he added.

Miliband also read out a letter from King Charles III.

""As we all navigate the transition to cleaner energy for our planet and energy security for our citizens, summits such as these are of vital importance in facilitating shared learning between nations, particularly those in the global south and across the Commonwealth,"" King Charles wrote.

The UK government wants 95% of Great Britain's electricity mix to come from clean energy by the end of the decade -currently this stands around 60%.

Milibandtold the BBC's R4 Today programmethat this would guarantee lower energy bills by 2030.

Iceberg tracks found off UK coast could shed light on Antarctica,Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.,Climate,"Antarctic, Science & Environment, Glaciers, Climate",Mark Poynting and Georgina Rannard,2025-04-24T09:00:09.196Z,2025-04-24T09:00:09.196Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c8d6/live/a83c2fa0-20ed-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c8d6/live/a83c2fa0-20ed-11f0-9c65-a5c3dc449bf3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2xz664r2do,"Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.

Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.

It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.

The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.

The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.

This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.

The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.

Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.

""We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,"" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journalNature Communications.

""These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.""

Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.

By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.

That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.

The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved fromthe Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.

Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.

""Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'""

Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.

But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.

Exactly how this plays out, though, is ""one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise"", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.

That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.

No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.

By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.

The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.

That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.

And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.

The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.

Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.

""These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,"" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.

""But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,"" he argued.

Water industry admits sewage monitoring damaging public trust,The industry says powers to self-monitor water quality should be handed back to the regulator. ,Science & Environment,"Sewage, Environment, Water",Esme Stallard,2025-04-24T01:09:03.992Z,2025-04-24T01:09:03.992Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7c5d/live/17032aa0-2063-11f0-82ef-73284b78c058.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7c5d/live/17032aa0-2063-11f0-82ef-73284b78c058.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxngw96qrgo,"Water companies should no longer be allowed to monitor their own levels of sewage pollution, the industry body has told the BBC exclusively.

Instead they are proposing a new, third-party monitoring system to build consumer trust.

The recommendation is part of a submission made to the UK government's independent review into the water sector.

Campaigners have long complained the companies' self-reporting has prevented the true scale of pollution in UK water being revealed.

A third-party system could add more pressure to the regulators, which have also been criticised for not holding the companies to account.

A report from the National Audit Office examining the three water regulators (Ofwat, the Environment Agency, and the Drinking Water Inspectorate) and Defra, is expected on Friday.

David Henderson, CEO of industry body Water UK, told the BBC: ""We absolutely accept that self-monitoring is not helping to instil trust and so we would like to see an end to it, and in place of it a more robust, third-party system.""

As part of their permitting arrangements water companies are expected to regularly sample water quality to identify potential pollution, and submit this data to the Environment Agency in an arrangement known as ""operator self monitoring"".

But there have been incidents of misreporting by water companies in England and Wales uncovered by the regulators, who said some cases had been deliberate.

Southern Waterwas previously issued finestotalling £213m by the industry regulator (Ofwat) and the environmental regulator (the Environment Agency) for manipulating sewage data.

In that case, there was unreported pollution into numerous conservation sites whichcaused ""major environmental harm""to wildlife.

The company later admitted its actions ""fell short"".

Henderson added that the industry never asked to self-monitor, but that it was introduced in 2009 by the then Labour government to ""reduce the administrative burden"" on the Environment Agency (EA).

In 2023,the BBC reportedthat EA staff were concerned that, due to funding cuts, the Agency was increasingly relying on water companies to self-report rather than carrying out its own checks on pollution from sewage.

The current environment minister, Steve Reed, has promised to review the system,calling itthe equivalent of companies ""mark[ing] their own homework"".

But the National Audit Office (NAO), which reviews government spending, questioned the ability of regulators, like the EA, to take on any new monitoring.

""Regulators need to address the fact that they currently have limited oversight over whether water companies are carrying out their work as expected. It is hard to see how they will achieve this without increased overall capacity,"" said Anita Shah, NAO Director of Regulation.

It is expected to publish a full review of the regulation of the water sector on Friday.

A Defra spokesperson told the BBC: ""We are committed to taking decisive action to fix the water industry. The Water Commission's recommendations will mark the next major step [to] restore public trust in the sector.""

The government launched an independent water commission in October to review the sector and the way it is regulated. The public consultation closed on Wednesday with the findings expected in July.

Water UK submitted a 200-page document of recommendations, including this call to end self-monitoring.

The industry body also requested that water meters be universal across England and Wales to make bills fairer. At present about 60% of the population have a meter.

""The meter is just to ensure that people are paying for what they use as opposed to a flat rate of system where you can use virtually no water and pay the same as someone filling up a pool three times in a summer,"" said Henderson.

""This doesn't properly reflect the value of water and encourage people to conserve it in the way that we need,"" he added.

Bites on gladiator bones first evidence of combat with lion,Experts say the discovery provides the first physical evidence of gladiatorial combat with animals. ,North Yorkshire,York,Alex Moss ,2025-04-23T18:01:24.164Z,2025-04-23T18:01:24.164Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6d2c/live/e7d109b0-2034-11f0-9f40-15f12af7a309.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6d2c/live/e7d109b0-2034-11f0-9f40-15f12af7a309.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8v2063r19o,"Bite marks found on the skeleton of a Roman gladiator are the first archaeological evidence of combat between a human and a lion, experts say.

The remains were discovered during a 2004 dig at Driffield Terrace, in York, a site now thought to be the world's only well-preserved Roman gladiator cemetery.

Forensic examination of the skeleton of one young man has revealed that holes and bite marks on his pelvis were most likely caused by a lion.

Prof Tim Thompson, the forensic expert who led the study, said this was the first ""physical evidence"" of gladiators fighting big cats.

""For years our understanding of Roman gladiatorial combat and animal spectacles has relied heavily on historical texts and artistic depictions,"" he said.

""This discovery provides the first direct, physical evidence that such events took place in this period, reshaping our perception of Roman entertainment culture in the region.""

Experts used new forensic techniques to analyse the wounds, including 3D scans which showed the animal had grabbed the man by the pelvis.

Prof Thompson, from Maynooth University, in Ireland, said: ""We could tell that the bites happened at around the time of death.

""So this wasn't an animal scavenging after the individual died - it was associated with his death.""

As well as scanning the wound, scientists compared its size and shape to sample bites from large cats at London Zoo.

""The bite marks in this particular individual match those of a lion,"" Prof Thompson told BBC News.

The location of the bites gave researchers even more information about the circumstances of the gladiator's death.

The pelvis, Prof Thompson explained, ""is not where lions normally attack, so we think this gladiator was fighting in some sort of spectacle and was incapacitated, and that the lion bit him and dragged him away by his hip.""

The skeleton, a male aged between 26 and 35, had been buried in a grave with two others and overlaid with horse bones.

Previous analysis of the bones pointed to him being a Bestiarius - a gladiator that was sent into combat with beasts.

Malin Holst, a Senior Lecturer in Osteoarchaeology at the University of York, said in 30 years of analysing skeletons she had ""never seen anything like these bite marks"".

Additionally, she said the man's remains revealed the story of a ""short and somewhat brutal life"".

His bones were shaped by large, powerful muscles and there was evidence of injuries to his shoulder and spine, which were associated with hard physical work and combat.

Ms Holst, who is also managing director of York Osteoarchaeology, added: ""This is a hugely exciting find because we can now start to build a better image of what these gladiators were like in life.""

The findings, which have been published in the Journal of Science and Medical Research PLoS One, also confirmed the ""presence of large cats and potentially other exotic animals in arenas in cities such as York, and how they too had to defend themselves from the threat of death"", she said.

Experts said the discovery added weight to the suggestion an amphitheatre, although not yet found, likely existed in Roman York and would have staged fighting gladiators as a form of entertainment.

The presence of distinguished Roman leaders in York would have meant they required a lavish lifestyle, experts said, so it was no surprise to see evidence of gladiatorial events, which served as a display of wealth.

David Jennings, CEO of York Archaeology, said: ""We may never know what brought this man to the arena where we believe he may have been fighting for the entertainment of others, but it is remarkable that the first osteoarchaeological evidence for this kind of gladiatorial combat has been found so far from the Colosseum of Rome, which would have been the classical world's Wembley Stadium of combat.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8v2063r19o
Trial to boldly grow food in space labs blasts off,The mission will explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut.,Science & Environment,"Science & Environment, Space",Pallab Ghosh,2025-04-22T00:58:53.208Z,2025-04-22T00:58:53.208Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ae0f/live/ccf0e300-1f57-11f0-b265-abe347419ae3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ae0f/live/ccf0e300-1f57-11f0-b265-abe347419ae3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp34wzql2xvo,"Steak, mashed potatoes and desserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment launched into orbit today is successful.

A European Space Agency (ESA) project is assessing the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.

ESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to £20,000 per day.

The team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.

Lab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.

""Our dream is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon,"" he told BBC News.

""We need to build manufacturing facilities off world if we are to provide the infrastructure to enable humans to live and work in space"".

Lab-grown food involves growing food ingredients, such as protein, fat and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats and then processing them to make them look and taste like normal food.

Lab-grown chicken is already on sale in the US and Singapore and lab grown steak is awaiting approval in the UK and Israel. On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.

The researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to £20,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate.

Nasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space – something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.

Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.

""We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,"" he tells me.

""But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!""

This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.

He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: ""precision"" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.

In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.

""We can make all the elements to make food,"" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.

""We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes.""

A much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?

Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.

The data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.

The problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising – even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.

That is where Imperial College's master chef comes in. Jakub Radzikowski is the culinary education designer tasked with turning chemistry into cuisine.

He isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes. He tells me all sorts of dishes will be possible, once he gets the go-ahead to use lab-grown ingredients.

""We want to create food that is familiar to astronauts who are from different parts of the world so that it can provide comfort.

""We can create anything from French, Chinese, Indian. It will be possible to replicate any kind of cuisine in space.""

Today, Jakub is trying out a new recipe of spicy dumplings and dipping sauce. He tells me that I am allowed to try them out, but taster-in-chief is someone far more qualified: Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, who also has a PhD in chemistry.

We tasted the steaming dumplings together.

My view: ""They are absolutely gorgeous!""

Dr Sharman's expert view, not dissimilar: ""You get a really strong blast from the flavour. It is really delicious and very moreish,"" she beamed.

""I would love to have had something like this. When I was in space, I had really long-life stuff: tins, freeze dried packets, tubes of stuff. It was fine, but not tasty.""

Dr Sharman's more important observation was about the science. Lab-grown food, she said, could potentially be better for astronauts, as well as reduce costs to the levels required to make long-term off-world habitation viable.

Research on the ISS has shown that the biochemistry of astronauts' bodies changes during long duration space missions: their hormone balance and iron levels alter, and they lose calcium from their bones. Astronauts take supplements to compensate, but lab-grown food could in principle be tweaked with the extra ingredients already built in, says Dr Sharman.

""Astronauts tend to lose weight because they are not eating as much because they don't have the variety and interest in their diet,"" she told me.

""So, astronauts might be more open to having something that has been cooked from scratch and a feeling that you are really eating wholesome food.""

Canada election: Top candidates talk fossil fuels as climate agenda slips ,"Amid tariff threats from the US, energy and economic security are key issues in Canada's federal election. ",US & Canada,"Climate, Canada election 2025, Mark Carney, Canada",Matt McGrath,2025-04-21T23:16:49.029Z,2025-04-21T23:16:49.029Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2c78/live/eb1a46b0-1aa1-11f0-999d-89a1b86ed8d9.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2c78/live/eb1a46b0-1aa1-11f0-999d-89a1b86ed8d9.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87pev3jpyyo,"As the threat posed by US President Donald Trump tops Canada's federal election agenda, the issue of the country's contribution to global warming has been largely overshadowed.

The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.

Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.

It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.

In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.

That sense of unity is now long gone.

Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.

As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.

However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.

The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.

It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as ""Carbon Tax Carney"".

Some observers believe that cancelling the tax was a smart political move, others feel it was a mistake.

""By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,"" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.

""I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.""

Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into ""a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy"".

He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.

There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.

Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.

The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.

""We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,"" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.

""And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.""

Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.

He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers ""woke"" cultural issues.

Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.

While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace ""dirty coal"" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.

According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.

He told the BBC it's more ""at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable"".

Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.

That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.

Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.

""Our relationship with the US has completely changed,"" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.

""The pipelines are a national security problem for us.""

That concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets.

A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles.

In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track ""energy corridors"",  though Carneyhas flip-flopped on his support for pipelines,knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.

He is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn;  £4.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023.

And while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments.

Yves-François Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Québécois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a ""denial situation about climate change"".

""I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales"" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates.

Canada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005.

As of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%.

Whoever wins the election will have a real challenge to square that circle.

Canadians go to the polls on 28 April.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87pev3jpyyo
Santorini volcano probed for clues about next big explosion,Scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the island's next big one could be.,Europe,"Greece, Science & Environment","Georgina Rannard, Tom Ingham, Kevin Church",2025-04-20T23:59:02.890Z,2025-04-20T23:59:02.890Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bf92/live/283edf70-1588-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bf92/live/283edf70-1588-11f0-b1b3-7358f8d35a35.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm25lz56rezo,"Perched on top of Santorini's sheer cliffs is a world-famous tourist industry worth millions. Underneath is the fizzing risk of an almighty explosion.

A huge ancient eruption created the dreamy Greek island, leaving a vast crater and a horse-shoe shaped rim.

Now scientists are investigating for the first time how dangerous the next big one could be.

BBC News spent a day on board the British royal research ship the Discovery as they searched for clues.

Just weeks before, nearly half of Santorini's 11,000 residents had fled for safety when the island shut down in a series of earthquakes.

It was a harsh reminder that under the idyllic white villages dotted with gyros restaurants, hot tubs in AirBnB rentals, and vineyards on rich volcanic soil, two tectonic plates grind in the Earth's crust.

Prof Isobel Yeo, an expert on highly dangerous submarine volcanoes with Britain's National Oceanography Centre, is leading the mission. Around two-thirds of the world's volcanoes are underwater, but they are hardly monitored.

""It's a bit like 'out of sight, out of mind' in terms of understanding their danger, compared to more famous ones like Vesuvius,"" she says on deck, as we watch two engineers winching a robot the size of a car off the ship's side.

This work, coming so soon after the earthquakes, will help scientists understand what type of seismic unrest could indicate a volcanic eruption is imminent.

Santorini's last eruption was in 1950, but as recently as 2012 there was a ""period of unrest"", says Isobel. Magma flowed into the volcanoes' chambers and the islands ""swelled up"".

""Underwater volcanoes are capable of really big, really destructive eruptions,"" she says.

""We are lulled into a sense of false security if you're used to small eruptions and the volcano acting safe. You assume the next will be the same - but it might not,"" she says.

The Hunga Tunga eruption in 2022 in the Pacific produced the largest underwater explosion ever recorded, and created a tsunami in the Atlantic with shockwaves felt in the UK. Some islands in Tonga, near the volcano, were so devastated that their people have never returned.

Beneath our feet on the ship, 300m (984ft) down, are bubbling hot vents. These cracks in the Earth turn the seafloor into a bright orange world of protruding rocks and gas clouds.

""We know more about the surface of some planets than what's down there,"" Isobel says.

The robot descends to the seabed to collect fluids, gases and snap off chunks of rock.

Those vents are hydrothermal, meaning hot water pours out from cracks, and they often form near volcanoes.

They are why Isobel and 22 scientists from around the world are on this ship for a month.

So far, no-one has been able to work out if a volcano becomes more or less explosive when sea water in these vents mixes with magma.

""We are trying to map the hydrothermal system,"" Isobel explains. It's not like making a map on land. ""We have to look inside the earth,"" she says.

The Discovery is investigating Santorini's caldera and sailing out to Kolombo, the other major volcano in this area, about 7km (4.3 miles) north-east of the island.

The two volcanoes are not expected to erupt imminently, but it is only a matter of time.

The expedition will create data sets and geohazard maps for Greece's Civil Protection Agency, explains Prof Paraskevi Nomikou, a member of the government emergency group that met daily during the earthquake crisis.

She is from Santorini, and grew up hearing about past earthquakes and eruptions from her grandfather. The volcano inspired her to become a geologist.

""This research is very important because it will inform local people how active the volcanoes are, and it will map the area that will be forbidden to access during an eruption,"" she says.

It will reveal which parts of the Santorini sea floor are the most hazardous, she adds.

These missions are incredibly expensive, so Isobel crams in experiments night and day as the scientists work in 12-hour shifts.

John Jamieson, a professor at Canada's Memorial University in Newfoundland, shows us volcanic rocks extracted from the vents.

""Don't pick that one up,"" he warns. ""It's full of arsenic.""

Pointing to another that looks like a black and orange meringue with gold dusting, he explains: ""This is a real mystery - we don't even know what it is made of.""

These rocks tell the history of the fluid, temperature and material inside the volcano. ""This is a geological environment different to most others - it's really exciting,"" he says.

But the mission's beating heart is a dark shipping container on deck where four people stare at screens mounted on a wall.

Using a joystick that wouldn't look out of a place on a gaming console, two engineers drive the underwater robot. Isobel and Paraskevi trade theories about what is in a pool of fluid that the robot has found.

They have recorded very small earthquakes around the volcano, caused by fluid moving through the system and causing fractures. Isobel plays us an audio recording of the fractures reverberating. It sounds like the bass in a nightclub being amped up and down.

They identify how fluid moves through rocks by pulsing an electromagnetic field into the earth.

This is creating a 3D map that shows how the hydrothermal system is connected to the volcano's magma chamber where an eruption is generated.

The recent earthquake crisis in Santorini highlighted how exposed the island's residents are to the seismic threats and how reliant they are on tourism.

Back on dry land, photographer Eva Rendl meets me in her favourite location for wedding shoots. When the so-called swarm of earthquakes hit in February, she left the island with her daughter.

""It was really scary, as it got more and more intense,"" she says.

She's back now but business is slower. ""People have cancelled bookings. Normally I start shoots in April but my first job isn't until May,"" Eva says.

In the main square of Santorini's upmarket town Oia, British-Canadian tourist Janet tells us six of her group of 10 cancelled their holiday.

She believes more accurate scientific information about the likelihood of earthquakes and volcanoes would help others feel more reassured about visiting.

""I get the Google alerts, I get the scientists' alerts, and it helps me feel safe,"" she said.

But Santorini will always be a dream destination. In Imerovigli, we see two people climbing onto the curved rooftops to get the perfect shot.

The couple - married for just 15 minutes - travelled from Latvia and were not put off by the island's underwater risks.

Could taking carbon out of the sea cool down the planet?,A pilot project will test whether it is a useful way of fighting climate change. ,Climate,"Climate, Environment",Jonah Fisher ,2025-04-18T00:20:52.963Z,2025-04-18T00:20:52.963Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3f3c/live/179dc9f0-1610-11f0-998c-6b1bac7d7605.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3f3c/live/179dc9f0-1610-11f0-998c-6b1bac7d7605.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr788kljlklo,"A ground-breaking project to suck carbon out of the sea has started operating on England's south coast.

The small pilot scheme, known as SeaCURE, is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies that fight climate change.

There's broad consensus among climate scientists that the overwhelming priority is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the chief cause of global warming.

But many scientists also believe that part of the solution will have to involve capturing some of the gases that have already been released.



These projects, known as carbon capture, usually focus either on capturing emissions at source or pulling them from the air.

What makes SeaCure interesting is that it is testing whether it might be more efficient to pull planet-warming carbon from the sea, since it is present in greater concentrations in water than in the air.

To reach the project's entrance you have to go round the back of the Weymouth Sealife Centre and walk past a sign that says ""Caution: Moray Eels may Bite"".

There's a reason this ground-breaking project has been placed here.

It's a pipe that snakes under the stony beach and out into the English Channel, sucking up seawater and bringing it onshore.

The project is trying to find whether removing carbon from the water might be a cost effective way of reducing the amount of the climate warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere.

SeaCURE processes the seawater to remove the carbon before pumping it back out to sea where it absorbs more CO2.



We're the first broadcast journalists to visit and Professor Tom Bell from Plymouth Marine Laboratory is tasked with showing us around.

He explains that the process begins by treating some of the seawater to make it more acidic. This encourages the carbon that's dissolved in the seawater to turn into a gas and be released into the atmosphere as CO2.

""This is the seawater stripper"" Prof Bell says with a smile as we turn a corner.

The ""stripper"" is a large stainless steel tank which maximises the amount of contact between the acidic seawater and the air.

""When you open a fizzy drink it froths, that's the CO2 coming out."" Prof Bell says. ""What we're doing by spreading the seawater on a large surface area. It's a bit like pouring a drink on the floor and allowing the CO2 to come out of the seawater really quickly.""

The CO2 that emerges into the air is sucked away and then concentrated using charred coconut husks ready to be stored.

The low-carbon seawater then has alkali added to it – to neutralise the acid that was added – and is then pumped back out into a stream that flows into the sea.

Once back in the sea it immediately starts to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere contributing in a very small way to reducing greenhouse gases.

There are already much more developed carbon capture technologies which take carbon directly out of the air – but Dr Paul Halloran who leads the SeaCURE project tells me that using water instead has its advantages.

""Seawater has got loads of carbon in it compared to the air, about 150 times more,"" says Dr Halloran.

""But it has got different challenges, the energy requirements to generate the products that we require to do this from seawater are huge.""

At present the amount of CO2 this pilot project is removing is tiny – at most 100 metric tonnes per year – that's less CO2 than a commercial plane emits crossing the Atlantic. But given the size of the world's oceans those behind SeaCURE think it has potential.

In its submission to the UK government SeaCURE said the technology had the potential to be massively scaled up to remove 14 billion tonnes of CO2 a year if 1% of the world's seawater on the ocean's surface was processed.

For that to be plausible the entire process for stripping the carbon – would have to be powered by renewable energy. Possibly by solar panels in a floating installation at sea.

""Carbon removal is necessary. If you want to reach net zero emissions and net zero emissions is needed to halt further warming,"" says Dr Oliver Geden who's part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an expert in carbon capture.

""Capturing directly from seawater is one of the options. Directly capturing it from the air is another one. There are basically 15 to 20 options, and in the end the question of what to use, of course, will depend on the cost.""

The Seacure project has £3m of funding from the government and is one of 15 pilot projects being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.

""Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is essential in helping us achieve net zero,"" says energy minister Kerry McCarthy. ""Innovative projects like SeaCURE at the University of Exeter play an important role in creating the green technologies needed to make this happen, while supporting skilled jobs and boosting growth.""

There's also the question of what a large quantity of low-carbon water would do to the sea and the things that live in it. In Weymouth it dribbles out of a pipe in such small quantities it is unlikely to have any impact.

Guy Hooper is a PhD student at Exeter University and is researching the possible impacts of the project. He's been exposing marine creatures to low-carbon water under laboratory conditions.

""Marine organisms rely on carbon to do certain things,"" he says. ""So phytoplankton use carbon to photosynthesize while things like mussels also use carbon to build their shells.""

Hooper says early indications are that massively increasing the amount of low-carbon water could have some impact on the environment.

""It might be damaging but there might be ways to mitigate that – for example through pre-diluting the low-carbon water. It's important this is included in the discussion early on.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr788kljlklo
England's serious water pollution incidents at 10-year high,Campaigners release official data showing the most serious pollution incidents in England are double the target.,Science & Environment,"Sewage, Water pollution, Environment",Esme Stallard,2025-04-16T03:24:16.034Z,2025-04-16T03:24:16.034Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d44b/live/37a4e9d0-1a17-11f0-95f9-83e0a180f556.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d44b/live/37a4e9d0-1a17-11f0-95f9-83e0a180f556.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5rp6e75q4o,"The number of pollution incidents recorded by water companies in England is at a ten-year high, according to data obtained by campaigners.

Surfers Against Sewage said the Environment Agency data showed the number of incidents was more than double its target.

Such spills have the potential to cause damage to wildlife and illness for people making use of the country's rivers and seas.

Water UK, the industry body representing UK water and sewage companies, said companies plan to invest £12bn to reduce spills by the end of the decade.

As well as reporting the total number of sewage spills annually, environmental regulator the Environment Agency also records the number of pollution incidents, which are likely to cause serious harm to wildlife and people.

Eight years ago, the EA remarked that the water sector was not doing enough to reduce these incidents.It saidthis was causing ""distress to local communities and blighting rivers and beaches.""

The industry was set a target to reduce these incidents by 40% by 2025 against 2016 levels.

The latest publicly availably data is to the end of 2023. But following a Freedom of Information request, Surfers Against Sewage obtained the data up to the start of 2025.

This showed that 2,487 pollution incidents were recorded last year - a 31% increase on the 2016 levels, and almost double the original EA target.

""The water industry fails, fails and fails again,"" said Giles Bristow, CEO of Surfers Against Sewage.

He called for a reform of the system so that it ""prioritises public health and value for customer money and delivers healthy coastlines, rivers and lakes.""

Water UK responded to the findings on behalf of the nine companies responsible for handling sewage in England.

""We have been clear that the water system is not working and support the Independent Water Commission looking at every aspect of how the industry is regulated.

""However, no sewage spill is ever acceptable and water companies are investing £12 billion to almost halve spills from storm overflows by 2030,"" Water UK said.

Most of the money for that investment is expected to come from increases to water bills, which started to take effect this month.

The industry regulator Ofwat is allowing water companies to raise bills by an average of £31 each year over the next five years - but those rises don't include inflation, which means actual bills are likely to be higher.

The Water Commission is an independent review, set up by the government, to look at different ways of regulating the industry following increased public anger over water company performance.

Colossal squid filmed by scientists for first time in ocean,"Stunned scientists say the extremely rare squid can weigh up to 500kg (1,100lb).",Essex,"Colchester, Marine biology, University of Essex, Fish",Lewis Adams,2025-04-16T12:04:18.827Z,2025-04-16T13:15:00.232Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2bb2/live/f2155750-1ad0-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2bb2/live/f2155750-1ad0-11f0-8a1e-3ff815141b98.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99pg13yv32o,"A colossal squid has been filmed in its natural environment for the first time since the species was discovered 100 years ago.

The 30cm-long (11.8in) juvenile was caught on camera at a depth of 600m (1,968ft), near the South Sandwich Islands in the south Atlantic Ocean.

A team of scientists, led by a University of Essex academic, recorded the footage in March during a 35-day quest to find new marine life.

Experts believe colossal squid can grow up to 7m (23ft) in length and weigh up to 500kg (1,100lb) - making them the heaviest invertebrate on the planet.

The mollusc was discovered on the 100-year anniversary of itfirst being identified and named.

Crew onboard the Schmidt Ocean Institute's Falkor (too) vessel used a remote-controlled vehicle to spot it.

Chief scientist Dr Michelle Taylor, from the university, said the team was initially unsure what the squid was but filmed it because it was ""beautiful and unusual"".

The footage was then verified by Dr Kat Bolstad, who said previous squid encounters had mostly been as remains in whale and seabird stomachs.

""It's exciting to see the first in situ footage of a juvenile colossal and humbling to think that they have no idea that humans exist,"" she said.

Little is known about the colossal squid's life cycle, but they eventually lose the transparent appearance of juveniles.

Another distinguishing feature of the species is the presence of hooks on the middle of their eight arms.

Dying adults have previously been filmed by people fishing, but have never been seen alive at depth.

The Natural History Museum has suggested it ishard to estimate the global population of colossal squids.

In 2022, the institution said the lack of observations meant that ""even to this day, the enormous invertebrates still straddle the line between legend and reality"".

Scientists also revealed that, in January, they captured footage of a glacial glass squid for the first time ever.

""The first sighting of two different squids on back-to-back expeditions is remarkable and shows how little we have seen of the magnificent inhabitants of the southern ocean,"" added Dr Jyotika Virmani, Schmidt Ocean Institute's executive director.

""These unforgettable moments continue to remind us that the ocean is brimming with mysteries yet to be solved.""

"Wildfires pushing rare wildlife to extinction, say conservationists",Wildfires 'could spell the end' for rare species such as water voles and hen harriers.,Wales,"Wales, South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, Endangered species, Owls, Wildlife, Wildfires, Reptiles, Insects, Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service, Birds",Steffan Messenger,2025-04-15T21:47:40.645Z,2025-04-16T08:32:29.844Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9716/live/e9920830-1a21-11f0-9b40-6d3b8c877a52.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9716/live/e9920830-1a21-11f0-9b40-6d3b8c877a52.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2dej3x9432o,"Some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being ""torched alive"" and pushed closer to extinction after weeks of intense grass fires, conservationists have warned.

They include endangered birds like hen harriers and water voles, which are now the UK's fastest declining mammal.

The National Trust said it believed ongoing wildfires at Abergwesyn common in Powys had destroyed ""the last remaining"" local breeding habitat for golden plovers - considered one of the most beautiful birds of the British uplands.

So far this year 110 sq miles (284 sq km) of land has been burnt by wildfires around the UK - an area larger than Birmingham.

Figures obtained by the BBC show that in Wales, fire crews have battled almost 1,400 wildfires already this year, leading fire services to urge people to ""act responsibly"" and report any suspicious behaviour to the police.

The National Trust said 2025 was ""turning out to be the worst year ever for these human-caused fires across the country"".

""We're extremely worried, this is looking like it's going to be the worst year for seeing our wildlife going up in flames,"" said Ben McCarthy, the charity's head of nature conservation.

A record dry spell and unusually high temperatures in March are believed to have contributed to the fires. A low number of blazes in 2024 also left more vegetation to fuel them.

Coed Cadw, the Woodland Trust in Wales, said an ""irreplaceable"" area of temperate Atlantic rainforest had been affected at Allt Boeth near Aberystwyth, with damage to protected bluebells too.

Also known as Celtic rainforest, the habitat harbours scarce plants, lichens and fungi, and is considered more threatened than tropical rainforest.

In England, the National Trust said several thousand newly planted trees at Marsden Moor, in West Yorkshire,had gone up in flames.

While on the Morne Mountains, in Northern Ireland, invertebrates and ground dwelling animals like reptiles were ""simply being torched alive"".

""That then cascades through the food web because without the invertebrates you don't get the birds who are reliant on them for food,"" Mr McCarthy said.

He said government funding to help farmers and land managers restore peat bogs in the uplands, to prevent fires while also soaking in planet-warming carbon and providing habitat, was essential.

Conservation charities including The Wildlife Trusts and the Initiative for Nature Conservation Cymru (INCC) also voiced fears for the future of the water vole, which is already under serious threat from habitat loss and predation by American minks.

Small animals like water voles and shrews, which live in burrows, can survive fast-moving fires but their habitats and the food they rely on are destroyed.

Water voles are ""the fastest-declining mammal ever"" according to Rob Parry of the INCC.

""Their last foothold [in Wales] is in the uplands so when those sites are burned it is awful for that particular population, but from a UK point of view we are one step closer to the extinction of an entire species,"" he said.

The INCC is also monitoring five breeding pairs of barn owls in the Amman Valley in south Wales, where wildfires have destroyed huge areas of habitat.

""A few weeks ago they had all of this area to find food for their chicks and suddenly they don't have that any more,"" said Mr Parry.

""I don't know how they are going to cope. A wildfire just makes that habitat disappear overnight.""

Other rare birds are also affected, including hen harriers, which have been subject to  recent conservation efforts to increase their numbers in the Welsh uplands, and skylarks, which have declined in huge numbers since the 1970s.

""We're worried enough as it is about wildlife,"" said Mr Parry.

""We're one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world and wildfires every spring at the worst possible time is a burden that wildlife and the environment just can't cope with.""

The INCC has called for closer oversight of controlled burns by farmers and better monitoring of the impact of wildfires on the environment.

Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said wildfires were a ""massive issue"", particularly in south Wales, where Welsh government figures showed more than half of wildfires in Wales took place last year.

Becky Davies, a senior officer at NRW, said: ""In the last three days we've had over 75 fires in the south Wales valleys alone.

""We have a lot of hillsides that are linear, the valley side has a lot of bracken, a lot of heathland, grassland and coal spoil and that is the sort of hillside that goes up in flames.""

The environmental impact of wildfires can also be felt more widely.

When it rains after a fire, the newly bare soil and the phosphates that were trapped inside it can wash off into streams and rivers, affecting water quality.

Numbers of wildfires vary year-on-year depending on when spells of dry weather happen.

But figures obtained by the BBC show that in south Wales, grassfires have increased by 1,200% from the same time period last year.

From 1 January to 10 April 2024, there were 34 wildfires in the region, whereas there were 445 over the same dates in 2025.

In north Wales, crews have attended 170 fires this year, and Mid Wales Fire and Rescue said it had tackled 772 blazes.

Wildfires are also up in England and Northern Ireland compared to last year, while the fire service in Scotland has issued anextreme wildfire alertcovering the whole country.

Statistics show the majority of wildfires are started deliberately, but they can also be ignited from disposable BBQs or controlled burns that get out of hand.

In south Wales, firefighters are going to primary schools to teach children from a young age about the devastating impact.

At Pontnewydd Primary School in Cwmbran, staff from South Wales Fire and Rescue  Service and Gwent Police brought along animals like snakes, hedgehogs and foxes for children to meet.

Station manager Mark Bowditch said his crews saw the damage to wildlife from wildfires first-hand.

""We see the death of local wildlife, we see the destruction of their habitat,"" he said.

""We accept that some fires can be accidental, but deliberate fire setting is a crime and that's the message we'd like to get out.""

Katy Perry back on Earth after reaching space ,Six women - including pop star Katy Perry - blasted off into space as part of an all-women suborbital mission,Science & Environment,"Space tourism, Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos, Space exploration",Maddie Molloy,2025-04-14T07:54:39.996Z,2025-04-14T21:45:05.461Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5583/live/c8575700-195f-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5583/live/c8575700-195f-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg8e5gq8ljo,"Pop star Katy Perry and five other women safely returned to Earth after reaching space aboard Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin rocket.

The singer was joined by Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, who said a highlight of the flight was hearing Perry sing Louis Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"".

After landing back on Earth, Perry said she felt ""super connected to life"" and ""so connected to love"".

The flight lasted around 11 minutes and took the six women more than 100km (62 miles) above Earth, crossing the internationally recognised boundary of space and giving them a few moments of weightlessness.

Also on board were former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.

The New Shepard rocket lifted off from its West Texas launch site just after 08:30 local time (14:30 BST).

The capsule returned to Earth with a parachute-assisted soft landing, while the rocket booster also landed back in Texas.

Cheering could be heard from inside the capsule as the recovery crew went to collect them.

Jeff Bezos opened the capsule door to welcome back Lauren Sánchez, the first to disembark.

""I'm so proud of this crew,"" she said tearfully. ""I can't put it into words.""

She paused, before adding: ""I looked out of the window and we got to see the moon.""

""Earth looked so quiet,"" she said, adding that it was not what she expected. ""It was quiet, but really alive.""

Next out was Katy Perry, who kissed the ground and lifted a daisy to the sky - her daughter is called Daisy.

Gayle King also got on her knees and kissed the ground.

""I just want to have a moment with the ground, just appreciate the ground for just a second,"" she said.

The last to get out, Kerianne Flynn, pointed at the sky and shouted: ""I went to space.""

A celebrity cast had watched the launch from the ground.

Speaking from the viewing platform, Khloé Kardashian said: ""I didn't realise how emotional it would be, it's hard to explain. I have all this adrenaline and I'm just standing here.""

""Whatever you dream of is in our reach, especially in today's day and age. Dream big, wish for the stars—and one day, you could maybe be amongst them,""​ she added.

Oprah Winfrey spoke about her friend Gayle King, and revealed she was a nervous flier.

""I mean, for her—whew—anytime we're on a flight, she's in somebody's lap at the slightest bit of turbulence. She has real, real-world anxiety when it comes to flying. And this... this is her overcoming a wall of fear,"" she said.

The spacecraft was fully autonomous, requiring no pilots, and the crew did not manually operate the vehicle.

The last all-female spaceflight was over 60 years ago when Soviet Cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to travel into space on a solo mission aboard the spacecraft Vostok 6.

Since then, there have been no other all-female spaceflights but women have made numerous significant contributions.

The space tourism  industry is still in its infancy, so every successful launch is significant and demonstrates that these short, commercial flights can be carried out safely.

But some critics stress it is tourism, not space science, and professional astronauts undertake missions, including scientific research, for the benefit of humankind.

""A celebrity isn't an envoy of humankind - they go into space for their own reasons,"" Dr Kai-Uwe Schrogl, special advisor for political affairs at the European Space Agency, told BBC News.

""These flights are significant and exciting, but I think maybe they can also be a source of frustration for space scientists,"" he added. ""We see space flight as being for science, knowledge and the interests of humanity.

""Celebrities do it for amusement but get a lot more attention than the regular astronauts.""

The space flight also generated a range of response on social media, from enthusiasm to hostility.

Dr Tanya Harrison, from the Outer Space Institute experts network said: ""A lot of the comments that I saw on social media were things about, 'Oh, it's like the Real Housewives go to Mars' or 'It's the oligarchy in space, read the room, the timing is terrible.'""

But: ""There were a lot of positive takes as well. People were like, 'Oh, this is so cool. Katy Perry is going to space.'""

Dr Harrison, who had previously worked on Nasa missions to Mars said: ""The cynical part of me wants to call it a marketing stunt. This is a company promoting the fact they can launch tourists into space.""

However she noted the all-women team might ""change the demographics a little bit of who might want to do something like this.""

""Socially, they might have had some impact"", she said.

In a news conference after the flight, two of the women took issue with some of the criticism the mission had received, related for example to its cost.

""I feel that anybody who is criticising doesn't really understand what's happening here,"" said Gayle King.

She said that the astronauts had had a huge, positive response from young women and young girls.

Lauren Sánchez said she had got ""fired up"" about the criticism and would love to have the naysayers come to Blue Origin and see the thousands of employees who ""put their heart and soul into"" the missions.

Blue Origin is a private space company founded in 2000 by Bezos, the billionaire entrepreneur who also started Amazon.

Although Blue Origin has not released full ticket prices, a $150,000 (£114,575.85) deposit is required to reserve a seat—underlining the exclusivity of these early flights.

Alongside its suborbital tourism business, the company is also developing long-term space infrastructure, including reusable rockets and lunar landing systems.

The New Shepard rocket is designed to be fully reusable and its booster returns to the launch pad for vertical landings after each flight, reducing overall costs.

According to US law, astronauts must complete comprehensive training for their specific roles.

Blue Origin says its New Shepard passengers are trained over two days with a focus on physical fitness, emergency protocols, details about the safety measures and procedures for zero gravity.

Additionally, there are two support members referred to as Crew Member Seven: one provides continuous guidance to astronauts, while the other maintains communication from the control room during the mission.

The rise of space tourism has prompted criticism that it is too exclusive and environmentally damaging.

Supporters argue that private companies are accelerating innovation and making space more accessible.

Professor Brian Cox told the BBC in 2024: ""Our civilisation needs to expand beyond our planet for so many reasons,"" and believes that collaboration between NASA and commercial firms is a positive step.

Rocket engine exhaust contains gases and particles that can affect Earth's climate and ozone layer.

On its web page under the title""Protecting our Planet""Blue Origin claims: ""During flight, the only byproduct of New Shepard's engine combustion is water vapor with no carbon emissions.""

However, Eloise Marais, a professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Air Quality at University College London points out that water vapour too is a greenhouse gas and is a chemical that is not supposed to be in the upper layers of the atmosphere.

""It alters the chemistry of the stratosphere, depleting the ozone layer, and also forms clouds that affect climate,"" she says.

Experts say that as more rockets are launched, the risks of harming the ozone layer increases.

The high cost of space tourism makes it inaccessible to most people, with these expensive missions out of reach for the majority.

Critics, including actress Olivia Munn, questioned the optics of this particular venture, remarking ""there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs,"" during an appearance on Today with Jenna & Friends.

Footage shared online showed areas cloaked in a thick orange haze, with local media reporting power cuts and the suspension of flights in a number of regions.

Dust storms are common in Iraq, but some experts believe they are becoming more frequent due to climate change.

Pedestrians and police wore face masks to protect themselves from the dust and paramedics were on site to assist people with difficulty breathing, according to AFP.

Hospitals in Muthanna province in southern Iraq received at least ""700 cases of suffocation"", a local health official said.

More than 250 people were taken to hospital in Najaf province, and at least 322 patients including children were sent to hospitals in Diwaniyah province.

A further 530 people reported breathing issues in Dhi Qar and Basra provinces.

The sandstorm blanketed Iraq's southern provinces in an orange cloud that reduced visibility to less than one kilometre (0.62 mile).

The authorities were forced to shut down airports in the provinces of Najaf and Basra.

Conditions are expected to gradually improve by Tuesday morning, according to local weather services.

Iraq is listed by the UN asone of the five countriesmost vulnerable to climate change as it encounters regular sandstorms, sweltering heat and water scarcity.

Civil Guard police raided the couple's home on the island of Majorca after learning that they were owning and breeding rare feline species which they then sold on social media.

In total, 19 felines were found on the property and rescued by agents. They included a caracal, two servals and 16 hybrid felines.

The Civil Guard say the discovery was just ""the tip of the iceberg of a plot"" of a global criminal organisation involving breeders, transporters and vets.

""Most of the animals offered for sale came from countries such as Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine, to be smuggled into the European Union,"" the Civil Guard said.

The authorities said the couple's social media was ""extremely active"" as people from other countries contacted them to purchase these types of animals.

The animals were smuggled into the EU through Poland's border with Belarus and then distributed with false documents, they added.

Europe is a central hub for exotic wildlife trade and the illicit black market is on the rise, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).

The couple also advertised other animals through social media including hyenas, desert lynxes and pumas.

A clouded leopard - an animal native to the Himalayas - with a price tag of €60,000 (£52,000; $68,000) was also put up for sale online.

This raid was part of a wider operation which began last March. One other person is being investigated for selling various species of exotic animals on the internet.

The animals have been temporarily placed at the Son Servera Safari Zoo in Majorca. They may be later relocated to a rescue centre near Alicante, although this is still under discussion.

The high demand for exotic cats is fuelled by social media because the felines can be seen as a sign of wealth or status, according the IFAW.

But these cats – which require a lot of space – are difficult to look after.

""They are very aggressive and can pose a danger to people or other animals"" which leads to many people getting rid of them, the Spanish Civil Guard said.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8g7m54gkro
"Starlings vanishing from gardens, says conservation charity, RSPB","The Big Garden Birdwatch survey recorded the lowest ever numbers of starlings this year.

It says its Big Garden Birdwatch, which took place over the last weekend in January, recorded the lowest number of starlings since the survey began in 1979.

Starlings are common garden visitors, but one of the UK's fastest disappearing birds, with a sharp population decline since the 1960s.

They are known for their spectacular winter acrobatics, flying in huge flocks or murmurations.

RSPB chief executive, Beccy Speight, said though this year's results are a reason for concern, ""we can all do our bit to support these threatened birds"".

Emma Marsh, RSPB's executive director, told Radio 4's Today programme that it is a ""real shame"" because the starling is ""one of our most charismatic birds"".

She said small actions in people's gardens can benefit starlings and other wildlife.

These include avoiding pesticides, which reduce the number of insects around that starlings eat; having a mix of short and long grass to help starlings watch out for predators; keeping lawns natural with dandelions and clovers so there would be more invertebrates; and putting up nest boxes.

Ms Speight added: ""While our homes and gardens often provide the perfect place for individual people to help, we also urgently need governments and businesses to join us in the wider fight to restore our natural world.""

Almost 600,000 people across the UK took part in The Big Garden Birdwatch this year, counting more than nine million birds over the course of an hour in their garden or local park.

Prior to the year 2000, the starling was regularly the most numerous species recorded in the survey.

This year it dropped from third to fourth place behind the house sparrow, the blue tit and the wood pigeon.

The blackbird remained in fifth place.

The survey gives a snapshot of trends in garden birds, with data on the starling mirroring findings from long-term studies.

Starlings are a red listed species in the UK, considered a high conservation concern due to their declining numbers.

The UK breeding population declined by 82% between 1970 and 2022.

There is not enough evidence to explain what is causing the declines, but one reason could be that there is less grassland and insect food than there used to be because of intensive farming.

Modern housing and development have also reduced the availability of suitable nesting sites.

Titanic digital scan reveals new details of ship's final hours,The 3D replica corroborates eye witness accounts about what happened after the liner hit an iceberg. ,Science & Environment,"Science & Environment, RMS Titanic, Sinking of the Titanic, Technology",Rebecca Morelle ,2025-04-08T12:00:32.162Z,2025-04-08T12:00:32.162Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3a33/live/78f0bc50-1474-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3a33/live/78f0bc50-1474-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6gjwd0g6o,"A detailed analysis of a full-sized digital scan of the Titanic has revealed new insight into the doomed liner's final hours.

The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster.

The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.

And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.

""Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,"" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst.

The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection.

The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots.

More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the ""digital twin"",which was revealedexclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.

Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.

The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.

But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.

The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.

""It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,"" said Parks Stephenson.

""And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.""

The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.

Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.

Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.

The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.

Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.

This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.

All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.

""They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,"" he told the BBC.

""They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.""

A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.

It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.

""We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,"" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.

The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.

Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.

But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.

""The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,"" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.

""But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.""

Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.

The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.

Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.

The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.

""She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,"" said Parks Stephenson.

""Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6gjwd0g6o
Experts dispute Colossal claim dire wolf back from extinction,"Independent experts say three white wolf puppies are not dire wolves, as claimed by US company Colossal",Science & Environment,"Science & Environment, Biology, Nature, Animals",Victoria Gill,2025-04-08T11:20:52.092Z,2025-04-08T11:20:52.092Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/58ae/live/0d557cb0-1479-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/58ae/live/0d557cb0-1479-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9ejy3gdvo,"There is a magnificent, snow-white wolf on the cover of Time Magazine today - accompanied by a headline announcing the return of the dire wolf.

This now extinct species is possibly most famous for its fictional role in Game of Thrones, but it did exist - more than 10,000 years ago - when it roamed across the Americas.

The companyColossal Biosciences is behind today's headlines. It announced that it used ""deft genetic engineering and ancient DNA"" to breed three dire wolf puppies and to ""de-extinct"" the species.

But while the young wolves - Romulus, Remus, and Khaleesi - represent an impressive technological breakthrough, independent experts say they are not actually dire wolves.

Zoologist Philip Seddon from the University of Otago in New Zealand explained the animals are ""genetically modified grey wolves"".

Colossal publicised its efforts to use similar cutting edge genetic techniques to bring back extinct animals including the woolly mammoth and the Tasmanian tiger.

Meanwhile experts have pointed to important biological differences between the wolf on the cover of Time and the dire wolf that roamed and hunted during the last ice age.

Paleogeneticist Dr Nic Rawlence, also from Otago University, explained how ancient dire wolf DNA - extracted from fossilised remains - is too degraded and damaged to biologically copy or clone.

""Ancient DNA is like if you put fresh DNA in a 500 degree oven overnight,"" Dr Rawlence told BBC News. ""It comes out fragmented - like shards and dust.

""You can reconstruct [it], but it's not good enough to do anything else with.""

Instead, he added, the de-extinction team used new synthetic biology technology - using the ancient DNA to identify key segments of code that they could edit into the biological blueprint of a living animal, in this case a grey wolf.

""So what Colossal has produced is a grey wolf, but it has some dire wolf-like characteristics, like a larger skull and white fur,"" said Dr Rawlence. ""It's a hybrid.""

Dr Beth Shapiro, a biologist from Colossal Biosciences, said that this feat does represent de-extinction, which she described as recreating animals with the same characteristics.

""A grey wolf is the closest living relative of a dire wolf - they're genetically really similar - so we targeted DNA sequences that lead to dire wolf traits and then edited grey wolf cells... then we cloned those cells and created our dire wolves.""

According to Dr Rawlence though, dire wolves diverged from grey wolves anywhere between 2.5 to six million years ago.

""It's in a completely different genus to grey wolves,"" he said. ""Colossal compared the genomes of the dire wolf and the grey wolf, and from about 19,000 genes, they determined that 20 changes in 14 genes gave them a dire wolf.""

The edited embryos were implanted in surrogate domestic dog mothers. According to the article in Time, all three wolves were born by planned caesarean section to minimise the risk of complications.

Colossal, which was valued at $10bn (£7.8bn) in January, is keeping the wolves on a private 2,000-acre facility at an undisclosed location in the northern US.

The pups certainly look like many people's vision of a dire wolf and the story has gathered global attention. So why is this scientific distinction important?

""Because extinction is still forever,"" Dr Rawlence told BBC News. ""If we don't have extinction, how are we going to learn from our mistakes?

""Is the message now that we can go and destroy the environment and that animals can go extinct, but we can bring them back?""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9ejy3gdvo
Record number of illegal sewage spills in Windermere last year,Campaigners identified 140 illegal spill days into the beauty spot in 2024,Science & Environment,"Sewage, Pollution, Environment, Water",Jonah Fisher ,2025-03-31T05:02:29.274Z,2025-03-31T05:02:29.274Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6044/live/5aa61e40-0bf3-11f0-ac9f-c37d6fd89579.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6044/live/5aa61e40-0bf3-11f0-ac9f-c37d6fd89579.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg19q7pjdeo,"Sewage spilled illegally into England's largest lake on a record number of days last year, an analysis of water company data by campaigners suggests.

The analysis, which the BBC had exclusive access to, used United Utilities operational data to establish when the company was discharging sewage into Windermere when it should by law have been treating some of it.

The campaigners from Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) and Save Windermere identified 140 illegal spill days in 2024, more than in any of the three previous years.

United Utilities told BBC News that the campaigners' findings were ""inaccurate"" and some of the data ""erroneous"".

The company declined to put in writing, despite repeated requests, any specific examples of mistakes or omissions.

Regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency are both currently investigating United Utilities operations.

Part of the Lake District National Park Unesco World Heritage Site, Windermere is home to more than 14,000 people and its scenery attracts an estimated seven million visitors per year.

But its pristine image is under threat. Regular discharges of sewage into Windermere have been blamed for increasing nutrient levels and turning parts of the lake green – so called ""algal blooming.""

The BBC has regularly reported on discharges into Windermere. Last October it wasrevealed that a single pumping station had illegally spilled more than 140 million litres of raw sewage between 2020 and 2023. In 2023 BBC Panorama saidUnited Utilities was misreporting pollution incidents.

Earlier in March environment secretary Steve Reed called the amount of pollution entering the lake ""a disgrace"" and pledged to clean it up.

Last week the Environment Agency said United Utilities had spilled 77,817 times in 2024, the highest figure of all England's water companies.

Many of the spills will have been legal. All water companies are legally allowed to discharge raw sewage to stop the network getting overwhelmed and this now happens regularly during periods of heavy rain.

But almost all pumping stations and treatment plants operate under an environmental permit which specify that they must process or ""pass forward"" a certain amount of sewage and rainwater before spilling starts.

The campaigners cross-referenced United Utilities datasets showing when an asset was spilling against how much sewage it was treating at the time. The campaigners' analysis – which has been shared with and scrutinised by the BBC -  found days when illegal spills appear to have occurred at each of six sewage facilities around the lake, which combined to 140 days in 2024. That's more than in any of the previous three years, as the chart below shows.

The longest illegal spill the analysis identified was for 10 days from Hawkshead pumping station, which flows into Windermere via Cunsey Beck.

""This is an indication that their works have not been maintained properly or they're not being watched over properly,"" says Prof Peter Hammond, a mathematican and retired academic from campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution.

Prof Hammond's analysis of water company data has been cited by regulators and he has been praised in Parliament by water company executives for bringing problems to light they were previously unaware of.

The latest analysis covers four years of data from six sites that discharge sewage into the Lake Windermere catchment.

Comparisons over a longer time period are impossible as United Utilities has only had made full data sets available since 2021.

The regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency have since 2021 been investigating whether the water companies have been treating enough sewage before they start to spill. The EA call it a ""major criminal investigation"" while Ofwat call it ""the largest and most complex Ofwat has ever undertaken"".

Last week Yorkshire Water agreed to a £40m ""enforcement action"" after Ofwat uncovered ""serious failures"" in how it operated its treatment plant and network.

Ofwat declined to comment on the campaigner's findings as their investigation into United Utilities is ongoing.

In response to concerns about United Utilities the Environment Agency last year reviewed all of its environmental permits in the Windermere catchment and says this led directly to the water company tripling its investment plans for the area to £200m.

""We are currently carrying out investigations into suspected pollution incidents on the Windermere catchment and are unable to comment on these in detail until they have reached a conclusion,"" an EA spokesperson said when the campaigners' analysis was shared with them.

""Where we find breaches of environmental permits, we will take the appropriate enforcement action up to and including a criminal prosecution.""

United Utilities, which provides services to more than seven million people across north-west England, is more than £9bn in debt. Its chief executive Louise Beardmore confirmed to parliament in February that she was last year paid £1.4m including a bonus of £420,000.

""The methodology used by the campaigners is different to that used by the Environment Agency for its compliance assessments,"" the water company said in a statement.

""On top of that, erroneous data has been used, tags and naming conventions in data sets appear to have been misunderstood, and assumptions seem to have been made on whether different types of flow meters have been installed.""

""The methodology fails to use other corroborating information from the sites which would prove that spills did not occur. As a result, the numbers quoted are inaccurate.""

BBC News presented United Utilities with five examples of illegal spills the campaigners' analysis had identified using the company's data and asked for any evidence or explanation as to why they were not illegal. United Utilities repeatedly declined to do so in writing or on camera.

""What we're seeing is the failure of privatisation. We're seeing a prioritisation of dividend returns over the long-term environmental protection of places like Windermere"" says Matt Staniek from Save Windermere.

""The bill payer has paid for a service that has never fully been provided, and the illegality demonstrates that for all to see.""

Over the next five years bills in the United Utilities areawill go up by 32% above the rate of inflation. On average that will mean a rise of £86 for the year that starts in April.

Louise Beardmore said the rises will fund the ""largest investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in over 100 years"".

For Windermere that's set to mean nine wastewater treatment works, including two that were included in the campaigners' analysis being upgraded and a reduction in the number of overflows discharging into the lake.

The Swedish city fined for missing an environmental target,Gothenburg has to pay a financial penalty if it misses certain annual sustainability goals.,Europe,"Gothenburg, World of Business, International Business, Sweden, Green economy",MaryLou Costa,2025-03-31T01:39:10.217Z,2025-03-31T01:39:10.217Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/24e8/live/44ad74b0-0a38-11f0-80d5-ff7a1f4f7e48.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/24e8/live/44ad74b0-0a38-11f0-80d5-ff7a1f4f7e48.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx1rl8dk2o,"Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.

Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a ""sustainability linked loan"" or SLL.

This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.

Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.

Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; £8,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.

In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.

However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.

Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set ""ambitious"" targets.

""You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.

""We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.""

The improvements to the city's poorest areas – and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.

Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.

Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.

""For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,"" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.

""We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.

""I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.""

But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.

""What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?"" she says.

""What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.""

Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.

""People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,"" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.

Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.

Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023,according to datafrom financial news provider Bloomberg.

Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.

He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.

""It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,"" he says. ""You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.

""It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.""

One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed £10m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.

Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.

By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.

""If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.

""It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.""

Back in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.

""Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,"" he says.

""I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx1rl8dk2o

They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read ""Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck"" - a reference to the news that2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C thresholdin global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.

It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.

The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of ""idiots"".

""Drag them off the stage"", one audience member can be heard shouting, ""I hope you [expletive] get arrested,"" another says.

JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a ""criminal cult"" and its activists branded ""eco-loons"" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as ""deranged"" and says its members have ""unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics"".

The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.

But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption – and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours.The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at £1.1 million.

Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR – founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed ""festivals of resistance"".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.

The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached £37m.

And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.

It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls ""a more radical flank"".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.

The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.

The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.

The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, ""locking on"" – chaining or gluing yourself to something – and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime – providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.

In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.

Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to ""hang up the hi-vis"" – as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.

JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. ""Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,"" the group claimed.

The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: ""We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.""

And the group's wider goal – to end the production of oil and gas – has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.

In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to ""kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.""

That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.

""As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.

""We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,"" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.

JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a ""marginal impact"".

That is ""not due to lack of trying,"" he said. The failure lay with the UK's ""elites and our leaders"" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.

JSO has said its last protest – to be held at the end of April – will mark ""the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets"". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.

Two-clawed dinosaur species discovered in Gobi Desert,Duonychus is one of the few species of theropod dinosaur that evolved two-fingered hands.,Science & Environment,"Fossils, Palaeontology, Dinosaurs, Science & Environment",Tim Dodd,2025-03-25T15:26:27.293Z,2025-03-25T15:26:27.293Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c3bb/live/324a30c0-0997-11f0-88b7-5556e7b55c5e.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c3bb/live/324a30c0-0997-11f0-88b7-5556e7b55c5e.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7v3eln56no,"A rare new species of two-clawed dinosaur has been discovered by scientists in Mongolia's Gobi Desert.

The species, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, was unique within a group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which stood on their hind legs and usually had three claws.

It was medium-sized, with an estimated weight of approximately 260kg.

Researchers believe the species' long, curved claws and its ability to strongly flex them would have made it an efficient grasper of vegetation.

Therizinosaurs were a group of either herbivorous or omnivorous theropod dinosaurs that lived in Asia and North America during the Cretaceous Period, which began 145 million years ago and ended 66 million years ago.

They are exemplified by the massive, long-clawed form Therizinosaurus, featured in the film Jurassic World Dominion, and were ""awkward looking"", according to one of the study's authors Dr Darla Zelenitsky, associate professor at the University of Calgary.

The specimen was recovered from the Bayanshiree formation in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, which dates back to the Late Cretaceous period (between 100.5 to 66 million years ago).

Unesco, the UN's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, calls the Mongolian Gobi Desert the largest dinosaur fossil reservoir in the world.

The region is an especially important source of fossils from the later Cretaceous period, which is the last of the main three periods of the dinosaur age, representing the final phase of dinosaur evolution.

At nearly a foot long, the claws themselves were much larger than their underlying bone, the study revealed.

Besides better grasping, the two-fingered hands may have been used for display, digging, or as formidable weapons.

The most famous two-fingered theropods are species within the group tyrannosaurids, which includes Tyrannosaurus rex, but Duonychus evolved its two-fingered hands separately from them and from other two-fingered theropods.

The specimen also preserves the first keratinous sheath of a therizinosaur, an element that covers the claw much like human fingernails, aiding defence, movement, or prey catching.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7v3eln56no
'Unprecedented' Melsonby Iron Age hoard found by archaeologists,"Archaeologists say they have found more than 800 items dating back about 2,000 years.",England,"Archaeology, Melsonby, Metal detecting, History, University of Durham",Jessica Bradley,2025-03-25T01:41:32.568Z,2025-03-25T01:41:32.568Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/de1f/live/50972d40-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/de1f/live/50972d40-08ab-11f0-8723-3171587fdebe.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9241dq40qo,"Archaeologists have helped uncover one of the ""largest and most important"" Iron Age finds in the UK.

The Melsonby Hoard was discovered in a field near Melsonby, North Yorkshire, by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University.

It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago.

Historians believe the ""unprecedented"" find could lead to a ""major re-evaluation"" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time.

After the initial discovery was reported to the authorities in December 2021, the site was excavated in 2022, with the support of the British Museum and a £120,000 grant from Historic England.

Early analysis of the hoard, released on Tuesday, suggests a lot of the items had been purposefully burnt or broken before being buried as a show of power and wealth.

Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University, said the size and scale of the find was ""exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe"".

He said the hoard showed there was more wealth in the north of England at the time than previously thought.

""Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world,"" he said.

""The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.""

It is thought the objects may have been burnt on a funerary pyre before being buried, though no human remains were found.

Analysis: Danny Savage, BBC News

In the archaeology labs at Durham University there's a real buzz about the unveiling of the Melsonby Hoard. Curators feel this is the discovery of a lifetime.

Hundreds of recovered artefacts are spread out in a climate controlled room on long tables.

You have to use your imagination a bit, Iron Age artefacts from 2,000 years ago have rusted or faded and are far from their original glory.  Some of them were decorated with coral which has bleached over the centuries.

But it's the story they tell that's extraordinary.

Iron Age experts now have evidence that people 2,000 years ago had four wheel wagons as well as two wheel chariots.

They now have proof that Iron Age residents of northern England had trading connections with the continent and the growing Roman Empire.

This will keep experts busy for years.

There's also a bit of secrecy too. The exact location of the discovery is not being revealed over concern that rogue treasure hunters will turn up at night and start looking for other artefacts.

History is valuable - to different people in different ways.

Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.

They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.

Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance.

The objects were identified using scanning technology at the University of Southampton, which helped the archaeologists figure out how to excavate the objects without causing damage.

Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: ""This is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK.

""It sheds new light on Iron Age life in the north and Britain, but it also demonstrates connections with Europe.""

The Yorkshire Museum has launched a fundraising campaign to secure the hoard for its collections.

Andrew Woods, senior curator at the museum said: ""This Iron Age hoard is an unprecedented find in the north, which will help us to understand more about this remarkable period in our history.

""We have the exciting opportunity to save the hoard for the nation and the people of Yorkshire.

""By acquiring the hoard, we will be able to make it accessible to everyone and, working in partnership with others, we can learn more about this fascinating period, why the hoard was buried, how the objects may have been used and to cast light on to whom it may have belonged.""

A selection of objects from the hoard will be on display at the Yorkshire Museum from 25 March 2025.

Schools and hospitals get £180m solar investment from Great British Energy,The government has announced the funding for 200 schools and hospitals apiece across the UK.,N/A,Climate,Esme Stallard,2025-03-21T02:26:22.922Z,2025-03-21T02:26:22.922Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d0e2/live/0fe40fa0-05fb-11f0-88b7-5556e7b55c5e.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/d0e2/live/0fe40fa0-05fb-11f0-88b7-5556e7b55c5e.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80y2j8d92no,"Hundreds of schools and hospitals across the UK are set to receive £180 million for solar panels from the government's new state-owned energy company.

The first major investment from Great British Energy was announced on Friday as part of government efforts to reduce the country's planet-warming emissions.

The move was welcomed by the school leaders union and NHS providers who said it would also help to manage the ""enormous financial pressure"" of energy bills.

But Andrew Bowie, shadow energy secretary, said the government's net zero plans would make the country ""poorer"".

""Right now, money that should be spent on your children's education or your family's healthcare is instead being wasted on sky-high energy bills,"" said Energy Secretary Ed Miliband.

""Great British Energy's first major project will be to help our vital public institutions save hundreds of millions on bills to reinvest on the frontline,"" he added.

The government also hopes that the project, to provide solar panels for 200 schools and 200 hospitals, will reduce the use of fossil fuels across public property and help achieve its long-term climate goals.

This is not the first time such a project has existed - the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme, launched under the previous Conservative government, has been running for more than four years and distributed close to £3bn for green technologies.

This project in the first instance will target less than 1% of schools.

But Alex Green, head of Let's Go Zero - a national campaign to reduce the climate impact of schools - said it was a welcome first move.

""It is tough economic times, and to see this progress is a big step. [Whilst] acknowledging that 200 schools is a small starting point, to achieve this in one year is a good pace,"" she said.

The announcement has been strongly welcomed by schools, unions and NHS estate managers who have previously warned of the pressure of high energy bills.

In 2022, the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT) had said that a third of its leaders were predicting a budget deficit following a spike in energy costs.

Paul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary, said schools wanted to install solar panels as they provided cheaper energy than paying for gas, but the upfront cost could often be prohibitive.

""This announcement is therefore welcome and a step in the right direction. In the longer term, this should also help schools manage energy bills, which have been a source of enormous financial pressure in recent years,"" he said.

But the acting shadow energy secretary disagreed that the government's approach would save money.

""Labour's Net Zero zealotry is still set to make us poorer. The government is putting our very energy security at risk with their attacks on North Sea Oil and Gas - surrendering our energy independence to foreign powers like Russia,"" he said.

However, energy experts have said that investing in renewable energy could reduce this reliance on imports.

Jess Ralston, energy analyst at the think tank Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, said: ""This GB Energy funding is an investment into energy security as solar panels lower the amount of gas we need to import from people like Putin.""

The first solar panels are expected to be installed by the end of the summer and the government said it would focus them in areas of ""highest need"".

Dark Energy experiment shakes Einstein's theory of Universe,New research could force a fundamental rethink of the nature of space and time.,Science & Environment,"Physics, Science & Environment, Astronomy, Dark Energy",Pallab Ghosh,2025-03-19T21:59:12.745Z,2025-03-19T21:59:12.745Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1377/live/f5841cd0-0038-11f0-b50e-9d086302645f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1377/live/f5841cd0-0038-11f0-b50e-9d086302645f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4geldjjge0o,"The mysterious force called Dark Energy, which drives the expansion of the Universe, might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space, scientists have found.

Some of them believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation - one that could force a fundamental rethink.

This early-stage finding is at odds with the current theory which was developed in part by Albert Einstein.

More data is needed to confirm these results, but even some of the most cautious and respected researchers involved in the study, such as Prof Ofer Lahav, from University College London, are being swept up by the mounting evidence.

""It is a dramatic moment,"" he told BBC News.

""We may be witnessing a paradigm shift in our understanding of the Universe.""

The discovery of Dark Energy in 1998 was in itself shocking. Up until then the view had been that after the Big Bang, which created the Universe, its expansion would slow down under the force of gravity.

But observations by US and Australian scientists found that itwas actually speeding up. They had no idea what the force driving this was, so they gave it a name signifying their lack of understanding - Dark Energy.



Although we don't know what Dark Energy is - it is one of the greatest mysteries in science - astronomers can measure it and whether it is changing by observing the acceleration of galaxies away from each other at different points in the history of the Universe.

Several experiments were built to find answers, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson Arizona. It consists of 5,000 optical fibres, each one of which is a robotically controlled telescope scanning galaxies at high speed.

Last year, when DESI researchers found hints that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, many scientists thought that it was a blip in the data which would go away.

Instead, a year on, that blip has grown.

""The evidence is stronger now than it was,"" said Prof Seshadri Nadathur at the University of Portsmouth

""We've also performed many additional tests compared to the first year, and they're making us confident that the results aren't driven by some unknown effect in the data that we haven't accounted for,"" he said.

Thedatahas not yet passed the threshold of being described as a discovery, but has led many astronomers, such as Scotland's Astronomer Royal, Prof Catherine Heymans, of Edinburgh University, to sit up and take notice.

""Dark Energy appears to be even weirder than we thought,"" she told BBC News.

""In 2024 the data was quite new, no-one was quite sure of it and people thought more work needed to be done.

""But now, there's more data, and a lot of scrutiny by the scientific community, so, while there is still a chance that the 'blip' may go away, there's also a possibility that we might be edging to a really big discovery.""

So what is causing the variation?

""No one knows!"" Prof Lahav admits, cheerfully.

""If this new result is correct, then we need to find the mechanism that causes the variation and that might mean a brand new theory, which makes this so exciting.""

DESI will continue to take more data over the next two years, with plans to measure roughly 50 million galaxies and other bright objects, in an effort to nail down whether their observations are unequivocally correct.

""We're in the business of letting the Universe tell us how it works, and maybe it is telling us it's more complicated than we thought it was,"" said Andrei Cuceu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in California.

More details on the nature of Dark Energy will be obtained by the European Space Agency's (ESA)Euclid mission, a space telescope which will probe further than DESI and obtain even greater detail. It was launched in 2023 and ESA released the new images from the spacecraft today.

The DESI collaboration involves more than 900 researchers from more than 70 institutions, around the world, including Durham, UCL and Portsmouth University from the UK.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4geldjjge0o
Scientists at Antarctic Sanae IV base rocked by alleged assault ,A spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC there had been an assault at the station.,Climate,"Antarctic, Climate",Mark Poynting and Justin Rowlatt,2025-03-17T17:55:10.021Z,2025-03-18T09:03:34.090Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/de3e/live/4fcd82d0-0354-11f0-a516-450efd74f3ed.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/de3e/live/4fcd82d0-0354-11f0-a516-450efd74f3ed.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkm0k2j6edo,"A group of scientists due to work together for months at a remote Antarctic research station has been rocked after a member of the team was accused of physical assault.

A team of nine researchers were due to spend the Antarctic winter at the South African-run base, which sits about 170km (about 105 miles) from the edge of the ice shelf and is difficult to reach.

But a spokesperson for the South African government told the BBC ""there was an assault"" at the station, following earlier allegations of inappropriate behaviour from inside the camp.

In a further message seen by the BBC, the South African environment ministry said it was responding to the concerns with ""utmost urgency"".

South Africa's Sunday Times, which was first to report the story, said members of the team had pleaded to be rescued.

The ministry said that those in the team had been subject to ""a number of evaluations that include background checks, reference checks, medical assessment as well as a psychometric evaluation by qualified professionals"", which all members had cleared.

In a subsequent statement, the ministry added that it was ""not uncommon"" for individuals to have an initial adjustment when they arrive at extremely remote areas even if assessments showed no areas of concern.

It said when the vessel departed for Antarctica on 1 February ""all was in order"", and the incident was first reported to the ministry on 27 February.

The statement added the department ""immediately activated the response plan in order to mediate and restore relations at the base"".

""This process has been ongoing on an almost daily basis in order to ensure that those on the base know that the Department is supportive and willing to do whatever is needed to restore the interpersonal relationships, but also firm in dealing with issues of discipline,"" it said.

The department said allegations of sexual harassment were also being investigated, but that reports of sexual assault were incorrect.

The department added that a government minister was personally handling the incident, and the alleged perpetrator had ""willingly participated in further psychological evaluation, has shown remorse and is willingly cooperative to follow any interventions that are recommended"".

The alleged perpetrator has also written a formal apology to the victim, it said.

The Sanae IV research base is located more than 4,000km from mainland South Africa and harsh weather conditions mean scientists can be cut off there for much of the year.

The base typically houses staff who stay through the Antarctic winter for approximately 13 months.

South African research expeditions have been taking place since 1959. The team to the Sanae IV base typically comprises a doctor, two mechanics, three engineers, a meteorological technician and a couple of physicists.

These expeditions, with harsh weather conditions mandating a lot of time spent in a confined indoor space, normally run without incident.

But on Sunday, South Africa's Sunday Times reported that one member of the team had sent an email warning of ""deeply disturbing behaviour"" by a colleague and an ""environment of fear"".

A South African government spokesperson told the BBC that the alleged assault was triggered by ""a dispute over a task the team leader wanted the team to do – a weather dependant task that required a schedule change"".

Incidents in Antarctica are rare, but not unprecedented. In 2018 there were reports of a stabbing at the Russian-operated Bellingshausen research station.

Psychologists point to the effect that isolation can have on human behaviour.

""One thing we know from these rare occurrences, when something bad happens in enforced isolation or capsule working, is that it's often the small things, tiny things that can blow up into conflict,"" said Craig Jackson, professor of workplace health psychology at Birmingham City University, and a chartered member of the British Psychological Society.

""So issues about hierarchy, about workload allocation, even small things about leisure time or rations or food portions can rapidly flare up to become something much larger than they typically are,"" he told the BBC.

Gabrielle Walker, a scientist and author who has been on expeditions to Antarctica, said working in such close proximity to a small group of colleagues had risks.

""You know exactly how they put their coffee cup down and what direction the handle points in; you know that they scratch their nose three times before they sit down; you know everything about them.

""And in the bad circumstances, it can start to irritate you… because there's nothing else – there's no other stimulus and you're with people 24/7,"" she said.

Sources within the Antarctic research community have told the BBC that South Africa has access to an ice-capable ship and aircraft if needed.

But any rescue operation would have to contend with the harsh climate, with temperatures well below freezing and the possibility of strong winds.

"With the world heating up, why are more SUVs being sold? ","Despite dire predictions of climate breakdown, more Sports Utility Vehicles are being spotted on, and off, the roads.",Science & Environment,"Effects of global warming, Environment", Navin Singh Khadka,2025-03-17T00:03:34.562Z,2025-03-17T00:03:34.562Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/56b3/live/4ed58e30-01a7-11f0-a8b1-950887ddc6e5.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/56b3/live/4ed58e30-01a7-11f0-a8b1-950887ddc6e5.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c778ekg64mjo,"Across the globe more and more Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) are being spotted on – and off – the roads.

This is despite predictions from the United Nations of an inevitable pivot towards smaller and more environmentally friendly vehicles because of the urgency of the climate crisis and the rising cost of living.

That pivot has not materialised: globally, 54% of the cars sold in 2024 were SUVs, including petrol, diesel, hybrids and electric makes. This is an increase of three percentage points from 2023 and five percentage points from the year before, according toGlobalData.

Of the SUVs which are now on the road – both new and older models – 95% are burning fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Manufacturers, however, say their new fleets of such cars are increasingly becoming electric, and that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.

SUVs are hard to miss. They are heavy and larger with spacious interiors, higher ground clearance and a high driving position which some say gives a better view of the road, although smaller versions are also on the market.

Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace see SUVs as one of the villains of the climate crisis and argue that their manufacturing consumes significant resources given their size.

Experts also say they require larger batteries to power their electric versions, which then further increases the demand for critical minerals, putting even more pressure on the planet.

Momentum was thought to be with smaller, energy-efficient electric vehicles. But the sales of standard-sized electric vehicles (EVs) has actually decreased in major markets such as Japan and Germany, and their sales growth has slowed in India.

And in Europe, sales of SUVs have outpaced those of EVs despite indications more than half a decade ago of an opposite trend. In Europe in 2018, 3.27 million small hatchbacks – both those powered by fossil fuels and those by electricity – were sold while 2.13 million were sold in 2024, according toGlobalData.

Its sales forecast manager Sammy Chan said: ""This is partly because of the SUV alternatives being offered in smaller [sizes] whose sales in Europe have now grown to nearly to 2.5 million in 2024 from 1.5 million in 2018.""

China saw the largest sales of nearly 11.6 million SUVs in 2024 followed by the US, India and Germany, according to GlobalData.

Industry experts say people's purchasing power has been improving in many fast-emerging economies, making SUVs the likelier choice of car.

""Manufacturers respond to consumer demand and, increasingly, drivers are attracted to dual purpose vehicles given their practicality, comfort and good view of the road,"" said Mike Hawes who is the chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

Automobile industry analysts also say that manufacturers are attracted to high profit margins from SUVs: they can make more money from SUVs even though they make fewer vehicles.

""It is the industry that has driven the demand through huge marketing and advertising campaigns in recent years,"" said Dudley Curtis, the communications manager at the European Transport Safety Council.

""SUVs offered the industry a simple way of charging more for a vehicle that does the same thing [as others],"" he said.

Because of the robust growth in SUVs sales, the IEA says oil consumption of these  vehicles has increased by 600,000 barrels per day globally between 2022 and 2023, accounting for more than a quarter of the total annual rise in global oil demand.

""If ranked among countries, the global fleet of SUVs would be the world's fifth largest emitter of CO2, exceeding the emissions of Japan and various other major economies,"" said Apostolos Petropoulos, an energy modeller with the IEA.

The agency says that even when compared to medium-sized cars that run on petrol and diesel, SUVs burn 20% more of such fuels as they weigh up to 300 kg more on average.

In fact, road transport is responsible for more than 12% of global carbon emissions which is the main driver of global warming. Scientists say all sectors must rapidly decarbonise if we are to avoid a climate catastrophe.

But industry representatives say in response that not all SUVs now being sold cause an increase in emissions.

""Around two in five of these [new] vehicle models are zero emission as their body type lends itself well to electrification with longer battery range that can reassure consumers concerned about charging accessibility,"" said Hawes, from the SMMT.

""This has led to the average CO2 emissions of new dual purpose cars more than halving since 2000, helping the segment lead the decarbonisation of UK road mobility.""

Although the vast majority of new SUVs still burn fossil fuels, IEA officials have said that over 20% of SUVs sold in 2023 were fully electric, up from 2% in 2018.

As for hybrids that can run on both electricity and fossil fuels, a study in Europe by the International Council on Clean Transportation in 2022 found only around 30% of the total distance driven by plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (all types including SUVs) was in electric mode on average.

Similar results were found in other major economies such as the US and China.

Overall, the back-gear towards SUVs, some experts say, has caused a significant setback in the decarbonisation of the transport sector.

""The trend toward heavier and less efficient vehicles such as SUVs (in countries where it is happening) has largely nullified the improvements in energy consumption and emissions achieved elsewhere in the world's passenger car fleet,"" said the IEA.

The UK Parliament's climate change committee had a similar finding in its 2024 report on decarbonisation in the country.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c778ekg64mjo
Toxic town impact as most high-risk contaminated sites unchecked,BBC investigation finds nine out of ten high-risk contaminated areas have not been tested.,Wales,Wales,Tomos Morgan,2025-03-13T00:54:45.520Z,2025-03-13T13:01:49.304Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6705/live/c5fa8de0-ffda-11ef-b436-8b92165e5268.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6705/live/c5fa8de0-ffda-11ef-b436-8b92165e5268.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gez4zgk8ko,"Thousands of sites potentially contaminated with toxic chemicals in Britain have never been checked by councils, a BBC investigation has found.

Nine out of 10 ""high-risk"" areas have not been tested by councils responding to a BBC Freedom of Information request and scientists fear they could pose a health risk as they are thought to contain substances such as lead or arsenic.

The BBC Shared Data Unit found of 13,093 potentiallytoxic sitesthat councils have identified as high risk, only 1,465 have been inspected.

The UK government said local unitary authorities had a statutory duty to inspect potentially contaminated sites but councils claim they do not have the money to do it.

TheEnvironmental Protection Actrequires councils to list all potential contaminated sites, and inspect the high-risk ones to make sure people and property are not at risk.

But after contacting all 122 unitary authorities in Wales, Scotland and England about their contaminated land, 73 responded to the BBC's Shared Data Unit Freedom of Information request which revealed there were 430,000 potential sites identified in the early 2000s.

Of those, 13,093 were considered to be potentially high risk, which experts said should have then been subject to physical testing. Yet, more than 11,000 of them remain unchecked to this day.

Half of Wales' 22 councils told the BBC they could not or would not give us figures - but those that did, identified 698 high-risk sites of which 586 have not been inspected.

The research comes after the release ofnew Netflix drama Toxic Townwhich tells the story of families fighting for justice following one of theUK's biggest environmental scandals.

The BBC's findings raise fresh questions about what exactly has been left beneath our feet from the UK's heavy industrial past.

""What we don't do in this country is do a full economic evaluation on the cost of things, including health and that feels almost criminal,"" said Dr Ian Mudway, a leading expert on the effect of pollution on human health.

""I'm not even certain we've achieved the point of scratching the surface.""

Contaminated land is a site that might have been polluted from its previous use - it could have been a factory, power station, a railway line, landfill site, petrol station or dry cleaners.

If you live in a property constructed after 2000, any contamination issues should be covered by updated planning laws.

But if you live in a property built before 2000, the rules are less clear.

Where Robin Morris lives is home to more than 400 of Wales' 1,300 abandoned metal mines and its three rivers, the Ystwyth, Rheidol and the Clarach, are some of the most heavily-polluted in the UK.

The Cwmystwyth mines in north Ceredigion date back to the Bronze Age and were abandoned in 1950, but spoils including a high level of zinc, cadmium and lead scatter the landscape and have polluted the River Ystwyth below.

Many Cwmystwyth locals, like Robin, have filtration systems installed if they receive their water from the hills where the old mines were.

""We installed an advance filtration system and were assured it would take absolutely everything,"" he said.

The BBC took a soil sample from Robin's garden on the banks of the Ystwyth and it revealed a very high reading of lead - well above the recommended safe level for gardening.

""It causes alarm bells to ring,"" Robintold BBC Wales Investigates.

""In light of the figures from your soil sample, we should have stopped growing vegetables long ago.""

It's just one sample, but other things that have happened in the past now seem to make more sense.

""We had ducks and chickens, a couple of the ducks went lame and we did consult the vet, he thought it was because of lead contamination,"" added Robin.

Ceredigion council said it was liaising with Wales' environmental body National Resources Wales to continually assess the health impact from the area's mining legacy.

Dr Mudway insists there was""no safe level""of lead and told the BBC it could impact children's development as well as kidney and cardiovascular disease in adults.

""Nothing is more of a forever chemical than lead,"" added the environmental toxicologist at Imperial College London.

""This is a hazard that has not gone away and is still a clear and present danger to the population.

""It's one of the few chemical entities for which we can calculate a global burden of disease - between half a million to just under a million premature deaths per year because of the release of lead into our environment.

""When you talk about the cost of ensuring that land is safe... that costs money up front.

""The costs of potential health effects, especially if they contribute to chronic diseases which people live with for 10 or 20 years, or the costs of remediating land, after when you realise that it's a high-level, dwarf the profits made at the other end of that cycle. That feels almost criminal.

""The health cost is hardly considered at all.""

When Manon Chiswell was a toddler she suddenly stopped talking - doctors advised her family she was showing lots of autistic traits.

""I do have memories of being very closely monitored in Meithrin [nursery]... I always had an adult with me,"" said Manon, now 20.

""I couldn't speak... they had to use a traffic light system, and yes or no cards to redirect me and help me communicate.""

But a blood test later found high levels of lead in Manon's blood.

She was not autistic, she had been poisoned.

Her father, Huw Chiswell, believed Manon was most likely poisoned at their home in Cardiff, which was near an old industrial site.

""She used to eat earth [as a toddler] in the garden,"" he said.

""There were railway sidings not far from where we lived at the time, so it's difficult to draw any other conclusions really, because once she'd stopped the eating, she got better.""

But it is not just about lead - agovernment reportsuggests that sites posing the greatest health risks were also contaminated by chemicals such as arsenic, nickel, chromium, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in soil or water.

Campaigners want a new law forcing councils to keep a public register of all potential contaminated sites.

It is led by the parents of aseven-year-old boy who died from poisonous gasafter the River Thames flooded their home in 2014, and they believe the fumes came from a nearby landfill.

Zane's law - named after Zane Gbangbola - also calls for measures such as more money for councils to identify and test possible sites.

""You have to know that it exists before you can protect yourself,"" said Zane's dad Kye Gbangbola, who was left paralysed after the gas poisoning.

""Until we have Zane's Law people will remain unprotected.""

When tighter regulations on dealing with potentially contaminated land became law 25 years ago, the minister that pushed them through wanted just that.

Now John Selwyn Gummer feels UK government funding cuts has meant far fewer inspections.

""There is no way in which local authorities can do this job without having the resources,"" said Lord Deben.

""Successive governments have under-provided for the work that we need to do.""

Several councils have told the BBC that funding is the reason they had stopped checking possible contaminated land.

Phil Hartley was one of hundreds of officers across the UK that used to check potential sites as Newcastle's former council contamination officer.

He said the central government grant removal had led to a ""collapse"" in checks.

""Since the money dried up very, very few councils proactively go out looking for contaminated land sites because the council doesn't want to take the risk of finding them,"" said Mr Hartley.

""There's a possibility that some people's health is being threatened, which is not great.""

The UK government said local authorities had a statutory duty to inspect potentially contaminated sites, require remediation and maintain a public register of remediated land.

""Any risk to public health from contaminated land is a serious matter,"" a spokesperson from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.

They also asked the Environment Agency to produce a new state of contaminated land report to provide the ""best possible baseline of data to measure future policies related to contaminated land against"".

The bodies that represent councils in Wales and England both said a lack of cash meant they could not fulfil their duty.

The Welsh Local Government Association said while Wales' 22 councils took their responsibility to check sites ""seriously"", progress was ""increasingly constrained by a lack of dedicated funding and specialist resources"".

England's Local Government Association said: ""Without adequate funding, councils will continue to struggle to provide crucial services - with devastating consequences for those who rely on them.""

The truth about life on other planets and what it means for Earth,Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other?,BBC InDepth,"Science & Environment, Mars, Nasa, Extraterrestrial life, Planets, Space exploration",Pallab Ghosh,2025-04-17T00:11:47.614Z,2025-04-17T00:11:47.614Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/468f/live/8b7c5530-1b6a-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/468f/live/8b7c5530-1b6a-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8jwj90ejno,"Listen to this article on BBC Sounds

There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.

One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.

Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.

""This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,"" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.

But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?

Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.

It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.

But decades on, what has been described as ""the strongest evidence yet"" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.

Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.

Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.

Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.

Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.

But many are in what astronomers call ""The Goldilocks Zone"" where the distance is ""just right"" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.

As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.

The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.

And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.

Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.

But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)

Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.

It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.

Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.

Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.

Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.

""With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence"".

The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.

In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.

A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.

The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.

The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.

China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.

But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.

""It is a long, slow process,"" she says. ""The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.

""You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route"".

Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles‘ song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with ""marmalade skies"".

Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.

Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?

""I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,"" she says, beaming with delight.

""Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.

If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.

Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be ""pretty common"" in the galaxy. ""But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.""

Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.

""When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.

""The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?""

He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.

As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves ""more displaced"" from that point. ""I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,"" he says.

Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.

""The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.

""If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger"".

Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.

""When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.

""It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,"" he continues.

""It will be another step in our evolution"".

Nasa astronauts Butch and Suni finally back on Earth,Dolphins circled their capsule after it landed off the coast of Florida.,Science & Environment,Science & Environment,"Rebecca Morelle, Alison Francis and Greg Brosnan",2025-03-19T00:14:48.610Z,2025-03-19T00:14:48.610Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1dd0/live/d396c300-0490-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/1dd0/live/d396c300-0490-11f0-97d3-37df2b293ed1.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mw221z2yyo,"After nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have finally arrived back on Earth.

Their SpaceX capsule made a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, before four parachutes opened to take them to a gentle splashdown off the coast of Florida.

A pod of dolphins circled the craft.

After a recovery ship lifted it out of the water, the astronauts beamed and waved as they were helped out of the hatch, along with fellow crew members astronaut Nick Hague and cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.

""The crew's doing great,"" Steve Stich, manager, Nasa's Commercial Crew Program, said at a news conference.

It brings to an end a mission that was supposed to last for just eight days.

It was dramatically extended after the spacecraft Butch and Suni had used to travel to the International Space Station suffered technical problems.

""It is awesome to have crew 9 home, just a beautiful landing,"" said Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator, Nasa's Space Operations Mission Directorate.

Thanking the astronauts for their resilience and flexibility, he said SpaceX had been a ""great partner"".

The journey home took 17 hours.

The astronauts were helped on to a stretcher, which is standard practice after spending so long in the weightless environment.

They will be checked over by a medical team, and then reunited with their families.

""The big thing will be seeing friends and family and the people who they were expecting to spend Christmas with,"" said Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut.

""All of those family celebrations, the birthdays and the other events that they thought they were going to be part of - now, suddenly they can perhaps catch up on a bit of lost time.""

The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.

They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.

But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.

Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.

So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.

It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return.

The only catch was this had a planned six-month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.

The Nasa pair embraced their longer-than-expected stay in space.

They carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who spent the most hours outside of the space station. And at Christmas, the team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers - sending a festive message fora Christmas that they had originally planned to spend at home.

And despite the astronauts being described as ""stranded"" they never really were.

Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.

Now the astronauts have arrived home, they will soon be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.

Long-duration missions in space take a toll on the body, astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight.

It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity.

British astronaut Tim Peake said it could take a while to re-adjust.

""Your body feels great, it feels like a holiday,"" he told the BBC.

""Your heart is having an easy time, your muscles and bones are having an easy time. You're floating around the space station in this wonderful zero gravity environment.

""But you must keep up the exercise regime. Because you're staying fit in space, not for space itself, but for when you return back to the punishing gravity environment of Earth. Those first two or three days back on Earth can be really punishing.""

In interviews while onboard, Butch and Suni have said they were well prepared for their longer than expected stay - but there were things they were looking forward to when they got home.

Speaking to CBS last month, Suni Williams said: ""I'm looking forward to seeing my family, my dogs and jumping in the ocean. That will be really nice -  to be back on Earth and feel Earth.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mw221z2yyo
Why scientists are counting tiny Antarctic krill from Space ,Differences in seawater colour could reveal how tiny Antarctic creatures are faring in a warming world.,Climate,"Antarctic, Marine life, Climate",Victoria Gill,2025-02-04T01:59:32.359Z,2025-02-04T01:59:32.359Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7cd9/live/86e274b0-e225-11ef-87aa-53645de28b43.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7cd9/live/86e274b0-e225-11ef-87aa-53645de28b43.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20g41845jdo,"Scientists say subtle differences in the colour of seawater will enable them to count tiny - but critically important - Antarctic marine creatures, from Space.

The target of the new research effort is Antarctic krill, which are just a couple of inches long and one of the most abundant and important animals on the planet.

Marine wildlife - including whales, penguins, seals and seabirds – all feed on these diminutive creatures.

However, conservation scientists are concerned that fishing and climate change could be having a negative impact on them and say we need new ways to monitor the creatures.

""Antarctic krill are the superheroes of the Southern Ocean,"" said Rod Downie, chief polar adviser at the wildlife charity WWF-UK.

""They are tiny, unsung heroes that sustain incredible marine life, but climate change and unsustainable fishing are putting them at risk.""

Researchers from the University of Strathclyde, WWF and the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) are developing a new way to use satellites to work out how many krill are in the ocean around Antarctica.

The key is in subtle differences in how much light seawater absorbs - depending on how many krill are swimming in it.

Dr Cait McCarry, from the University of Strathclyde, has just returned from a trip to Antarctica, where she caught krill in order to measure this effect.

""We start with seawater, then we add in a krill and take a measurement [of how much light the water absorbs],"" she explained. ""Then we add another krill and take another measurement.""

This analysis of exactly how the density of krill alters the colour of the ocean will, researchers say, allow them to take snapshots of the krill population from satellites - monitoring the population from Space.

Krill are food for some of the largest animals on the planet - including giant whales that migrate thousands of kilometres, to Antarctica, to feed on them.

They are also the foundation of a healthy ocean - part of a virtuous cycle: Whales eat krill,  krill eat microscopic plants that live in sea ice, and those plants absorb planet-warming carbon as they grow. When whales poop (in vast quantities), that fertilises the planet-cooling marine plants.

However, as the ocean temperatures rise with global warming, conservation scientists are concerned that this cycle could be disrupted, and that krill could be vulnerable.

Mr Downie said: ""We urgently need to better manage the fishery and protect krill habitats within a network of marine protected areas.

Samples of the space rock, which were scooped up by a Nasa spacecraft and brought to Earth, contain a rich array of minerals and thousands of organic compounds.

These include amino acids, which are the molecules that make up proteins, as well as nucleobases - the fundamental components of DNA.

This doesn't mean there was ever life on Bennu, but it supports the theory that asteroids delivered these vital ingredients to Earth when they crashed into our planet billions of years ago.

Scientists think those same compounds could also have been brought to other worlds in our Solar System.

""What we've learned from it is amazing,"" said Prof Sara Russell, a cosmic mineralogist from the Natural History Museum in London.

""It's telling us about our own origins, and it enables us to answer these really, really big questions about where life began. And who doesn't want to know about how life started?""

The findings are published in two papers in the journals Nature and Nature Astronomy.

Grabbing a bit of Bennu has been one of the most audacious missions Nasa has ever attempted.

A spacecraft called Osiris Rex unfurled a robotic arm to collect some of the 500m-wide space rock, before packing it into a capsule and returning it to Earth in 2023.

About 120g of black dust was collected and shared with scientists around the world. This might not sound like much material, but it's proved to be a treasure trove.

""Every grain is telling us something new about Bennu,"" said Prof Russell, who's been studying the tiny specks.

About a teaspoonful of the asteroid was sent to scientists in the UK.



The new research has shown that the space rock is packed full of nitrogen and carbon-rich compounds.

These include 14 of the 20 amino acids that life on Earth uses to build proteins and all four of the ring-shaped molecules that make up DNA  - adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine.

The study has also found an array of minerals and salts, suggesting water was once present on the asteroid. Ammonia, which is important for biochemical reactions, was discovered in the sample too.

Some of these compounds have been seen in space rocks that have fallen to Earth, but others haven't been detected until now.

""It's just incredible how rich it is. It's full of these minerals that we haven't seen before in meteorites and the combination of them that we haven't seen before. It's been such an exciting thing to study,"" said Prof Russell.

This latest study adds to growing evidence that asteroids brought water and organic material to Earth.

""The early Solar System was really turbulent and there were millions of asteroids like Bennu flying about,"" explained Dr Ashley King, from the Natural History Museum.

The idea is that these bombarded the young Earth, seeding our planet with ingredients that gave us the oceans and made life possible.

But Earth wasn't the only world getting hit by space rocks. Asteroids would have been colliding  with other planets too.

""Earth is unique, in that it's the only place where we have found life so far, but we know asteroids were delivering those ingredients, the carbon and the water, throughout the Solar System,"" said Dr King.

""And one of the big things that we're trying to understand now is, if you have the right conditions, why do we have life here on Earth - and could we potentially find it elsewhere in our Solar System?""

It's a key question that scientists will continue to try and answer.

They have decades of research ahead on the dust brought back from Bennu, and parts of our cosmic neighbourhood still to explore.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vd1zjlr5lo
SpaceX Starship test fails after Texas launch,"Officials at Elon Musk's company said the upper stage was lost, minutes after it launched.",US & Canada,"Elon Musk, Texas, Space exploration, United States",George Wright,2025-01-17T00:19:22.629Z,2025-01-17T02:27:56.968Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ea3a/live/4b9d64f0-d4b5-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ea3a/live/4b9d64f0-d4b5-11ef-87df-d575b9a434a4.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy77x09y0po,"The latest test of Space X's giant Starship rocket has failed, minutes after launch.

Officials at Elon Musk's company said the upper stage was lost after problems developed after lift-off from Texas on Thursday.

But the Super Heavy booster managed to return to its launchpad as planned, prompting an eruption of applause from ground control teams.

The mission came hours after the first flight of the Blue Origin New Glenn rocket system, backed by Amazon boss Jeff Bezos.



The two tech billionaires both want to dominate the space vehicle market.

""Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn. Teams will continue to review data from today's flight test to better understand root cause,"" SpaceX posted on X.

""With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability.""

Unverified footage shared on social media shows what appears to be the rocket breaking up in flames.

And footage showed orange balls of light flying across the sky over the Haitian capital of Port-Au-Prince, leaving a trail of smoke behind.

""Success is uncertain, but entertainment is guaranteed!"" Mr Musk posted on X, sharing a video showing a fiery trail streaking though the sky.

He also said ""improved versions"" of the ship and booster were ""already waiting for launch"".

""Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity,"" Musk said a short while later, adding that ""nothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month"".

Footage of the launch clocked up 7.2m views, according to a SpaceX livestream.

The Starship system had lifted off from Boca Chica, Texas, at 17:38 EST (22:38 GMT) in the company's seventh test mission.

The Starship upper stage separated from its Super Heavy booster nearly four minutes into flight as planned.

But then SpaceX communications manager Dan Huot reported on a live stream that mission teams had lost contact with the ship.

The Super Heavy booster managed to return to its launchpad roughly seven minutes after lift-off as planned, prompting an eruption of applause from ground control teams.

The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was aware ""an anomaly occurred"" during the SpaceX mission.

""The FAA briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling. Normal operations have resumed,"" it said in a statement.

It comes a day after a SpaceX rocket blasted off from Florida carrying two privately constructed lunar landers and a micro rover to the Moon.

The uncrewed Falcon 9 launched from the Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday.

And Bezos' Blue Origin companysuccessfully launched a rocket into orbitfor the first time.

It was a huge step forward for Bezos and his company that has spent years getting to the point of sending a rocket into orbit.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy77x09y0po
New Glenn Rocket launch challenges Elon Musk's space dominance,Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's space company blasts its first rocket into orbit in a challenge to Elon Musk.,Science & Environment,"Science & Environment, Jeff Bezos, Space exploration",Georgina Rannard,2025-01-16T08:12:27.977Z,2025-01-16T08:12:27.977Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6525/live/7a47edf0-d3f4-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6525/live/7a47edf0-d3f4-11ef-94cb-5f844ceb9e30.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24eg7z7zgo,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's space company has blasted its first rocket into orbit in a bid to challenge the dominance of Elon Musk's SpaceX.

The New Glenn rocket launched from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida at 02:02 local time (07:02 GMT).

It firmly pits the world's two richest men against each other in a commercial space race, vying to fly bigger and more powerful rockets.

Both want to populate the skies with more satellites, run private space stations, and provide transport for regular trips by people to the Moon.

""Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!"" Musk wrote in a post to Bezos on X.

Dave Limp, CEO of Bezos's space company Blue Origin, said he was ""incredibly proud"".

""We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring,"" he added.

Bezos's team overcame technical barriers that caused delays earlier this week when ice formation halted a launch.

Blue Origin's employees and crowds gathered near Cape Canaveral cheered as the 98 meters-high rocket hurtled into orbit.

But the company failed to land New Glenn's main rocket engine, or booster, onto a platform in the Atlantic Ocean.

It had hoped that the booster would be reusable for future launches but after about 20 minutes of flight, the company confirmed it had lost the engine.

Bezos's company Blue Origin has struggled to match the pace set by SpaceX. But this launch will be seen as a major step forward for the business.

The New Glenn rocket was named after John Glenn, the first American astronaut to orbit Earth more than 60 years ago.

The rocket is more powerful than SpaceX's most commonly used rocket, the Falcon 9. It can also carry more satellites, and Bezos wants to use it as part of his Project Kuiper, which aims to deploy thousands of low-earth satellites to provide broadband services.

That project would compete directly with Musk's Starlink service.



Jeff Bezos founded Blue Origin 25 years ago, claiming he wanted ""millions of people working and living in space.""

For years the venture has sent a smaller, reusable rocket called New Shepard to the edge of Earth's atmosphere. It has carried passengers and payloads, including Bezos himself in 2021.

But Blue Origin has been dramatically outperformed by SpaceX, which launched its rockets 134 times last year.

And SpaceX's new generation of rocket, called Starship, is more powerful still. The company hopes to launch it in its seventh test flight later today.

Some experts say a successful New Glenn rocket will create real competition between the two companies and could drive down the costs of space operations.

""What you are going to see are these two companies challenge each other to make even greater strides,"" suggests Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University in the UK.

Governments have historically spent billions on building rockets and sending missions into space.

But US space agency NASA is increasingly moving away from relying only on public money and has issued huge contracts to private companies to provide rockets and other space services.



Elon Musk's SpaceX has already received billions of dollars worth of space contracts.

His close relationship with the next US president, Donald Trump, could strengthen his company further.

Future of space: Could robots really replace human astronauts?,Advances in technology raise questions about the need to send people to space - and the risks and cost ,BBC InDepth,"Space tourism, SpaceX, Nasa, Apollo 11 Moon landing, Astronauts, Space, Space exploration",Jonathan O’Callaghan,2024-12-31T01:46:51.130Z,2024-12-31T01:46:51.130Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6e06/live/26519540-c150-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6e06/live/26519540-c150-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7keddnj31o,"On Christmas Eve, an autonomous spacecraft flew past the Sun, closer than any human-made object before it. Swooping through the atmosphere, Nasa's Parker Solar Probe was on a mission to discover more about the Sun, including how it affects space weather on Earth.

This was a landmark moment for humanity – but one without any human directly involved, as the spacecraft carried out its pre-programmed tasks by itself as it flew past the sun, with no communication with Earth at all.

Robotic probes have been sent across the solar system for the last six decades, reaching destinations impossible for humans.During its 10-day flyby, the Parker Solar Probe experienced temperatures of 1000C.

But the success of these autonomous spacecraft – coupled with the rise of new advanced artificial intelligence – raises the question of what role humans might play in future space exploration.

Some scientists question whether human astronauts are going to be needed at all.

""Robots are developing fast, and the case for sending humans is getting weaker all the time,"" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK's Astronomer Royal. ""I don't think any taxpayer's money should be used to send humans into space.""

He also points to the risk to humans.

""The only case for sending humans [there] is as an adventure, an experience for wealthy people, and that should be funded privately,"" he argues.

Andrew Coates, a physicist from University College London, agrees. ""For serious space exploration, I much prefer robotics,"" he says. ""[They] go much further and do more things.""

They are also cheaper than humans, he argues. ""And as AI progresses, the robots can be cleverer and cleverer.""

But what does that mean for future generations of budding astronauts – and surely there are certain functions that humans can do in space but which robots, however advanced, never could?

Robotic spacecraft have visited every planet in the solar system, as well as many asteroids and comets, but humans have only gone to two destinations: Earth's orbit and the Moon.

In all, about 700 people have been to space, since the earliest in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin from the then-Soviet Union became the first cosmic explorer. Most of those have been into orbit (circling the Earth) or suborbit (short vertical hops into space lasting minutes, on vehicles like the US company Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket).

""Prestige will always be a reason that we have humans in space,"" says Dr Kelly Weinersmith, a biologist at Rice University, Texas and co-author of A City on Mars. ""It seems to have been agreed upon as a great way to show that your political system is effective and your people are brilliant.""

But aside from an innate desire to explore, or a sense of prestige, humans also carry out research and experiments in Earth's orbit, such as on the International Space Station, and use these to advance science.

Robots can contribute to that scientific research, with the ability to travel to locations inhospitable to humans, where they can use instruments to study and probe the atmospheres and surfaces.

""Humans are more versatile and we get stuff done faster than a robot, but we're really hard and expensive to keep alive in space,"" says Dr Weinersmith.

In her 2024 Booker Prize-winning novel Orbital, author Samantha Harvey puts it more lyrically: ""A robot has no need for hydration, nutrients, excretion, sleep… It wants and asks for nothing.""

But there are downsides. Many robots are slow and methodical – for example on Mars, the rovers (remote-controlled motor vehicles) trundle along at barely 0.1mph.

""AI can beat human beings at chess, but does that mean they'll be able to beat human beings in exploring environments?"" asks Dr Ian Crawford, a planetary scientist at the University of London. ""I just don't think we know.""

He does, however, believe that AI algorithms might enable rovers to be ""more efficient"".

Technology can play a part in complementing human space travel by freeing up astronauts from certain tasks to allow them to focus on more important research.

""[AI could be used to] automate tedious tasks,"" explains Dr Kiri Wagstaff, a computer and planetary scientist in the US who previously worked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. ""On the surface of a planet, humans get tired and lose focus, but machines won't.""

The challenge is that vast amounts of power are needed to operate systems like large language models (LLM), which can understand and generate human language by processing vast amounts of text data. ""We are not at the point of being able to run an LLM on a Mars rover,"" says Dr Wagstaff.

""The rovers' processors run at about a tenth [of the speed] that your smartphone has"" – meaning they are unable to cope with the intense demands of running an LLM.

Complex humanoid machines with robotic arms and limbs are another form of technology that could take on basic tasks and functions in space, particularly as they more closely mimic the physical capabilities of humans.

Nasa's Valkyrie robot was built by the Johnson Space Center to compete in a 2013 robotics challenge trial. Weighing 300lb and standing at 6ft2in, it looks not unlike a Star Wars Stormtrooper, but it is one of an increasing number of human-like machines with superhuman abilities.

Long before the Valkyrie was created, Nasa'sRobonautwas the first humanoid robot designed for use in space, taking on tasks that were otherwise performed by humans.

Its specially designed hands meant it could use the same tools as astronauts and carry out complex, delicate tasks like grasping objects or flicking switches, that were too challenging for other robotic systems.

A later model of the Robonaut was flown to the International Space Station on the space shuttle Discovery in 2011, where it helped with maintenance and assembly.

""If we need to change a component or clean a solar panel, we could do that robotically,"" says Dr Shaun Azimi, lead of the dexterous robotics team at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Texas. ""We see robots as a way to secure these habitats when humans aren't around.""

He argues that robots could be useful, not to replace human explorers but to work alongside them.

Some robots are already working on other planets without humans, sometimes even making decisions on their own. Nasa's Curiosity rover, for example, isexploringa region called Gale Crater on Mars and autonomously performs some of its science without human input.

""You can direct the rover to take pictures of a scene, look for rocks that might fit science priorities for the mission, and then autonomously fire its laser at that target,"" says Dr Wagstaff.

""It can get a reading of a particular rock and send it back to Earth while the humans are still asleep.""

But the capabilities of rovers like Curiosity are limited by their slow pace. And there is something else they cannot compete with too. That is, humans have the added bonus of inspiring people back on Earth in a way that machines cannot.

""Inspiration is something that is intangible,"" argues Prof Coates.

Leroy Chiao, a retired Nasa astronaut who went on three flights to space in the 1990s and 2000s on Nasa's Space Shuttle and to the International Space Station, agrees. ""Humans relate when humans are doing something.

""The general public is excited about robotic missions. But I would expect the first human on Mars to be even bigger than the first Moon landing.""

Humans have not travelled further than Earth's orbit since December 1972, when the last Apollo mission visited the Moon. Nasa is hoping to return humans there this decade with its Artemis programme.

Thenext crewed missionwill see four astronauts fly around the Moon in 2026. A further mission, scheduled for 2027, will see Nasa astronauts land on the Moon's surface.

The Chinese space agency, meanwhile, also wants to send astronauts to the Moon.

Elsewhere Elon Musk, CEO of the US company SpaceX, has his own plans related to space. He has said that his long-term plan is to create a colony on Mars, where humans couldland.

His idea is to use Starship, a vast new vehicle that his company is developing, to transport up to 100 people there at a time, with the aim for there to bea million people on Mars in 20 years.

""Musk is arguing we need to move to Mars because that could be a backup for humanity if something catastrophic happens on Earth,"" explains Dr Weinersmith. ""If you buy that argument, then sending humans into space is necessary.""

However, there are large unknowns about living on Mars, including myriad technical challenges that she says remain unsolved.

""Maybe babies can't develop in that environment,"" she says. ""There [are] ethical questions [like this] that we don't have the answers to.

""I think we should be slowing down.""

Lord Rees has a vision of his own, though, in which human and robotic exploration might merge to the point that humans themselves are part-machine to cope with extreme environments. ""I can imagine they will use all of the techniques of genetic modification, cyborg add-ons, and so on, to cope with very hostile environments,"" he says.

""We may have a new species that will be happy to live on Mars.""

Until then, however, humans are likely to continue their small steps into the cosmos, on a path long trodden by robotic explorers before them.

New research prompts rethink on chances of life on Uranus moons,The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the sterile worlds scientists have long thought.,Science & Environment,"Science & Environment, Uranus, Space",Pallab Ghosh,2024-11-11T16:00:05.358Z,2024-11-11T16:00:05.358Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/36c3/live/d7d05950-9c2a-11ef-a65b-4d3707c63685.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/36c3/live/d7d05950-9c2a-11ef-a65b-4d3707c63685.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgk1333k0ypo,"The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought.

Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say.

Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa’s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago.

But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like.

Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds – as if it had been knocked over – making it arguably the weirdest.

We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons.

But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought.

The measurements from the spacecraft’s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus’s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun.

A planet’s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive.

This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system’s other planets and their moons.

But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day.

The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field.

So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London.

“These results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!”.

Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have beenpublished in the Journal Nature Astronomy.

“The results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,” she told BBC News.

“I’m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It’s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries”.

Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as “very exciting”.

“It shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions”.

Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research.

It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years’ time.

According to Nasa’s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey.

“Some of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries”.

Nasa’s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgk1333k0ypo
"Miliband urges global cooperation amidst energy ""challenges""",The UK Energy Secretary was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security. ,N/A,"Ed Miliband, Climate, Oil & Gas industry, Renewable energy",Esme Stallard,2025-04-24T10:50:30.532Z,2025-04-24T10:50:30.532Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f908/live/679e2200-20ed-11f0-8451-0101bb35273b.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f908/live/679e2200-20ed-11f0-8451-0101bb35273b.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8kr8k28z2o,"Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.

He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.

Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being ""weaponised"", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.

Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.

In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.

He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.

The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased ""international fragmentation"" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.

""Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.""

He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.

Global gas prices spikedfollowing the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.

Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threatas relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.

The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a ""success"" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.

Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.

""On the big calls – like the future of global oil demand – the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,"" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation

""As countries come together to shape a new energy security paradigm, they need unbiased, dependable data on the future direction of energy,"" he added.

Miliband also read out a letter from King Charles III.

""As we all navigate the transition to cleaner energy for our planet and energy security for our citizens, summits such as these are of vital importance in facilitating shared learning between nations, particularly those in the global south and across the Commonwealth,"" King Charles wrote.

The UK government wants 95% of Great Britain's electricity mix to come from clean energy by the end of the decade -currently this stands around 60%.

Milibandtold the BBC's R4 Today programmethat this would guarantee lower energy bills by 2030.

It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.

The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.

The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.

This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.

The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.

Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.

""We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,"" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journalNature Communications.

""These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.""

Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.

By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.

That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.

The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved fromthe Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.

Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.

""Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'""

Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.

But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.

Exactly how this plays out, though, is ""one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise"", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.

That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.

No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.

By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.

The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.

That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.

And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.

The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.

Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.

""These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,"" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.

""But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,"" he argued.

Canada election: Top candidates talk fossil fuels as climate agenda slips ,"Amid tariff threats from the US, energy and economic security are key issues in Canada's federal election. ",US & Canada,"Climate, Canada election 2025, Mark Carney, Canada",Matt McGrath,2025-04-21T23:16:49.029Z,2025-04-21T23:16:49.029Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2c78/live/eb1a46b0-1aa1-11f0-999d-89a1b86ed8d9.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2c78/live/eb1a46b0-1aa1-11f0-999d-89a1b86ed8d9.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87pev3jpyyo,"As the threat posed by US President Donald Trump tops Canada's federal election agenda, the issue of the country's contribution to global warming has been largely overshadowed.

The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US.

Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.

It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.

In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.

That sense of unity is now long gone.

Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.

As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26.

However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.

The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.

It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as ""Carbon Tax Carney"".

Some observers believe that cancelling the tax was a smart political move, others feel it was a mistake.

""By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,"" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body.

""I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.""

Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into ""a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy"".

He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.

There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.

Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.

The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.

""We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,"" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University.

""And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.""

Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.

He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers ""woke"" cultural issues.

Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.

While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace ""dirty coal"" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.

According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.

He told the BBC it's more ""at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable"".

Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.

That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.

Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.

""Our relationship with the US has completely changed,"" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.

""The pipelines are a national security problem for us.""

That concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets.

A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles.

In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track ""energy corridors"",  though Carneyhas flip-flopped on his support for pipelines,knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists.

He is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn;  £4.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023.

And while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments.

Yves-François Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Québécois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a ""denial situation about climate change"".

""I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales"" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates.

Canada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005.

As of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%.

Whoever wins the election will have a real challenge to square that circle.

The event began in 1970 in the United States, and is now marked around the world.

Earth Day is a global event which aims to highlight the importance of protecting the environment.

It takes place annually on 22 April.

It was set up in 1970 by Gaylord Nelson, a US senator and environmentalist, and Denis Hayes, a graduate student at Harvard University.

Both had growing concerns about environmental damage in the US, such as that caused by a large oil spill in 1969 in Santa Barbara, California.

They came up with Earth Day as a way to engage the public and push green issues to the national agenda.

The first Earth Day saw 20 million people across the US take to the streets.

It became a global event in 1990, and now involves more than one billion people of all ages in nearly 200 countries, according to organisers.

""Celebrating Earth Day is often the first environmental action for a lot of people,"" said Earthday.org president, Kathleen Rogers.

A simple guide to climate change

How the largest environmental movement in history was born

The official theme for 2025, ""Our Power, Our Planet"", focuses on renewable energy.

Previous events have covered a range of environmental issues, including climate change, plastic pollution and species protection.

This year, the organisers are calling for worldwide electricity generation from renewable sources - such as wind and solar - to triple by 2030.

This is similar to a pledge agreed at theCOP28 global climate conference in 2023to triple the capacity of renewables by 2030.

Renewables have been growing quickly, but are slightly off track to meet that promise, the International Energy Agency said in October.

Earth Day sees various local events take place in addition to the official theme, such as clean-ups of beaches, rivers and other spaces.

Four things you can do about your carbon footprint

Is the world making progress on tackling climate change?

Within a few years of the first Earth Day in 1970, the US Environmental Protection Agency had been set up, and several environmental laws - such as the Clean Air Act - had been established or significantly strengthened.

More recent events have included planting hundreds of millions of trees, supporting farmers with sustainable agriculture practices, and starting climate literacy projects around the world.

Some observers also cite the importance of Earth Day in pushing environmental issues back up national and international agendas.

""With a host of issues driving our environmental challenges down society's priority list, events like Earth Day remind us of the long-term cost of short-termism,"" said Yvo de Boer, former UN climate chief.

In 2016, Earth Day was symbolically chosen for the official signing of the landmark Paris climate accord, which had been agreed in late 2015.

It was the first time that countries of the world had collectively agreed targets to try to limit global warming.

What is the Paris climate agreement?

Some critics warn that these achievements give a false sense of progress.

Many environmental indicators - fromglobal temperaturestospecies extinctions- are changing rapidly due to human activities. Efforts to date have fallen far short of halting or reversing these trends.

Some individuals and companies have also been accused of using Earth Day as an opportunity to misleadingly promote their environmental credentials, without making the real changes that are needed.

This is known as ""greenwashing"".

For example, campaigner Greta Thunberg posted in 2022 that Earth Day ""has turned into an opportunity for people in power to post their 'love' for the planet, while at the same time destroying it at maximum speed"".

""We all know greenwashing is happening and it is infuriating,"" Earth Day organiser Ms Rogers told BBC News.

""It's not an issue we've caused, but we know Earth Day is used cynically by some businesses to [mis]use the ethos of sustainability for their own gain.""

""Governments need to take robust action and crack down on any business or industry lying to consumers.""

Dutton and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese were asked about the increasing impact of climate change, to which Dutton replied he would ""let scientists and others pass that judgment"".

He had previously said that flooding and natural disasters were ""part of the history of our state of this country"". The comments generated outrage from climate groups and mockery from Albanese.

""I believe in climate change, and that it is a reality"" Dutton said while campaigning on Monday.



During Wednesday's debate, Dutton responded to the moderator's question on whether flooding and natural disasters were getting worse by saying, ""I don't know because I'm not a scientist"".

""I can't tell you whether the temperature has risen in Thargomindah because of climate change or the water levels are up,"" he added.

Meanwhile Albanese, who had said Dutton's words showed ""no acceptance of the science of climate change"" continued mocking his opponent on Thursday, asking ""does he believe in gravity?""

Environmental organisations have reacted to Dutton's debate remarks with dismay.

Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie told the Guardian ""it's outrageous for a senior political leader to be so out of touch that they claim they ""don't know"" the risks Australians are facing.""

A report from the non-profit released earlier this month stated one in 23 properties across the country were found to be at high risk from climate change.

Australian Conservation Foundation Chief Executive Kelly O'Shanassy called Dutton's words ""a serious concern"" in an interview with the Canberra Times, adding that ""the next parliament is the last parliament that can get Australia's massive contribution to climate change under control.""

Albanese was also questioned on his climate policy during the debate, though for different reasons.

The prime minister has championed renewable energy throughout his time in office, but has faced backlash for rising power bills.

Asked when fees would fall, the prime minister did not directly reply. Instead, he stressed renewables were the ""cheapest form of power"".

In March, Labor announced it would extend a relief system for the bills, providing a further automatic $150AUD ($95;£72) rebate to households and small businesses.

The hour-long debate also saw the two party leaders pressed on other hot button issues for Australia includinghousingandforeign policy, in particular Australia's relationship to the US.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyq9pr47ejo
Global breakthrough agreement to tackle shipping emissions,Countries break ten-year deadlock to agree measures to reduce commercial shipping emissions.,N/A,"Greenhouse gas emissions, Climate, Shipping industry",Esme Stallard,2025-04-11T13:27:50.726Z,2025-04-11T13:27:50.726Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f7d7/live/02ab7bd0-1621-11f0-9956-c7de2971286b.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/f7d7/live/02ab7bd0-1621-11f0-9956-c7de2971286b.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20xxv22wl9o,"Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations.

The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines.

The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London – but it eventually passed on Friday.

Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal ""unfit for purpose"".

Shipping accounts foraround 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel.

But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions.

The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting.

It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel.

Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus.

The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia.

Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO.

There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships.

The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive.

""There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,"" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment.

""Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,"" he said.

In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water molecules to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process.

Figures vary depending on the fuel type butthe World Economic Forum estimatesthat these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce.

""There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,"" said Refke Gunnewijk, manager for clean industry & transport at the Port of Rotterdam.

Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped.

""Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5°C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,"" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu.

Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups.

""This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach"", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition.

It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade.

But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal.

Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise.

""It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,"" he said.

Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types.

""You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,"" he said.

Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a ""Net Zero"" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries.

It is this ""redistribution"" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then ""reciprocal measures"" would be taken.

Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement.

But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations.

The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised.

Now the committee have agreed the measure, it is expected to be formally adopted in October.

UK investigating fraud claims around green fuel HVO diesel,"The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a ""green"" diesel meant to cut emissions. ",Climate,"Palm oil, Department for Transport, Climate, Deforestation, Fuel",Matt McGrath and Mark Poynting,2025-04-08T23:03:15.676Z,2025-04-08T23:03:15.676Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c35d/live/dc7b9e60-147a-11f0-aff1-f1386d086010.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/c35d/live/dc7b9e60-147a-11f0-aff1-f1386d086010.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24n8nej94o,"The UK government is investigating a fast-growing ""green fuel"" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.

HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.

But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.

And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.

Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.

In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they ""take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information"".

HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.

UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.

Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.

But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.

That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.

This palm oil ""floods the market like cancer,"" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.

They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.

Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.

""I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,"" they said.

""I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.""

As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.

The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.

EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.

But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.

This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.

""It's a very easy game,"" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is ""fake"".

""Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,"" he told BBC News.

""There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.""

Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.

It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.

But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.

""ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,"" said Dr Christian Bickert.

""They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.""

This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.

Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.

""We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,"" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.

The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.

In a statement they said ""there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority"", adding that the ""ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be"".

In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.

The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.

It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.

In response, the ISCC said it was ""more than surprised"" by the EU's move, adding that it had been ""a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years"".

""The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels,"" it said.

Mystery of Welsh medieval cemetery deepens,Skeletons and artefacts unearthed from the site near Cardiff Airport are baffling archaeologists. ,Science & Environment,"Archaeology, Science & Environment, History",Rebecca Morelle ,2025-04-23T00:15:18.244Z,2025-04-23T00:15:18.244Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/31a2/live/5ba1d9f0-0a5f-11f0-9f24-e96387605aa3.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/31a2/live/5ba1d9f0-0a5f-11f0-9f24-e96387605aa3.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c241e3jr7qlo,"A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.

The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century,was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.

Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.

Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.

""Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,"" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.

About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.

So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.

""I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,"" said Dr Seaman.

""It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.""

The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.

""The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,"" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.

""It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.""

Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.

Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.

""Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,"" said Dr Seaman.

""It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.""

The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.

The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.

They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.

Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s.

Her skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.



Ten of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.

The results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.

Further DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.

The team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.

Because of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.

""They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,"" said Dr Faillace. ""And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.

""But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.""

The dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.

Andy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.

""We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,"" he said.

""We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.""

But for the moment there are still many contradictions that remain unsolved.

Titanic digital scan reveals new details of ship's final hours,The 3D replica corroborates eye witness accounts about what happened after the liner hit an iceberg. ,Science & Environment,"Science & Environment, RMS Titanic, Sinking of the Titanic, Technology",Rebecca Morelle ,2025-04-08T12:00:32.162Z,2025-04-08T12:00:32.162Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3a33/live/78f0bc50-1474-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/3a33/live/78f0bc50-1474-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6gjwd0g6o,"A detailed analysis of a full-sized digital scan of the Titanic has revealed new insight into the doomed liner's final hours.

The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster.

The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.

And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.

""Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,"" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst.

The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection.

The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots.

More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the ""digital twin"",which was revealedexclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.

Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.

The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.

But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.

The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.

""It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,"" said Parks Stephenson.

""And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.""

The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.

Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.

Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.

The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.

Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.

This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.

All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.

""They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,"" he told the BBC.

""They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.""

A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.

It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.

""We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,"" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.

The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.

Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.

But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.

""The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,"" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.

""But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.""

Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.

The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.

Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.

The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.

""She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,"" said Parks Stephenson.

""Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy6gjwd0g6o

Nasa astronauts Butch and Suni begin return to Earth,The Nasa astronauts prepare to head to Earth after an eight-day mission turned into nine months.,Science & Environment,"Science & Environment, SpaceX, Nasa, Astronauts, International Space Station",Rebecca Morelle ,2025-03-17T17:12:29.213Z,2025-03-18T06:07:59.888Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/52c7/live/83854b00-0316-11f0-81d9-675e79ab7115.jpg,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/52c7/live/83854b00-0316-11f0-81d9-675e79ab7115.jpg,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4k0d55q24o,"After an epic nine months in space, Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are finallyon their way home.

Their stay on the International Space Station (ISS) was only supposed to last eight days, but their mission was dramatically extended after the spacecraft that they arrived on suffered technical problems.

The pair are travelling back to Earth in a SpaceX capsule along with Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov.

They undocked from the ISS at 05:05 GMT (01:05 EDT) on Tuesday and are set to splash down off the coast of Florida later the same day, at 21:57 GMT (17:57 EDT) .

Their landing time, however, could change if the weather conditions are not good enough.

It will mark the end of a mission that has grabbed the world's attention, however the final stages of their journey won't be easy.

The SpaceX Dragon capsule will make a fast and fiery re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere, enduring temperatures of up to 1600C.

As it rapidly slows, the astronauts will experience significant g-forces, about four times the Earth's gravity.

Finally, four large parachutes will open, allowing the craft to land gently in the ocean.

Helen Sharman, Britain's first astronaut, said the thrilling ride would be worth it.

""They're experienced astronauts but they will feel fantastic to be back on Earth. The fresh air is the first thing that gets you,"" she told BBC News.

The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.

They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.

But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.

Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.

So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.

It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return. The only catch was this had a planned six month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.

The arrival of a replacement crew on Sunday was the final step needed for Butch and Suni's return – and after a short hand over with the new team, their mission is now at an end.

The Nasa pair have embraced their longer than expected stay in space.

They've carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who's spent the most hours outside of the space station.

And despite the astronauts being described as ""stranded"" they never really were.

Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.

Speaking in the weeks before their departure, Butch Wilmore said they weren't fazed when their mission was extended.

""We came up prepared to stay long, even though we plan to stay short. That's what we do in human space flight. That's what your nation's human space flight programme is all about,"" he said.

Suni added that she was sad this would probably be her last mission.

""I think just the fact that we're living up here, in this very unique place, gives you an amazing perspective,"" she said. ""I don't want to lose that spark of inspiration when I leave, so I'm going to have to bottle it somehow.""

The pair's mission attracted even more publicity last month after SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the astronauts had been left in space for political reasons, and his company could have brought them home sooner.

But Nasa officials said their decisions were based on flight scheduling and the space station's needs.

Garrett Reisman, a former Nasa astronaut and former director of space operations at SpaceX, said there were good reasons why Nasa didn't opt for a dedicated rescue mission.

""It wasn't going to reduce the amount of time that Butch and Suni spent in space by very much - I mean, you'd shave a couple of months off, so the benefit wasn't that great,"" he told BBC News.

""And the cost was high - these crew missions cost hundreds of millions of dollars…. I think Butch and Suni would have been the first ones to say 'no, that's not worth it'.""

Once the astronauts have arrived home, they will be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.

Long duration missions in space take a toll on the body, as astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight.

It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity. But the first priority for Butch and Suni will be to see their families, friends - and pets.

Garrett Reisman has been in touch with his friend Suni while she's been in space.

""I had an email from Suni just the other day where she talked about missing sitting on the porch in her house in Maine with the dogs, and smelling the fresh air, feeling the sun on your face,"" he told the BBC.

""It's the basic things about life here on Earth that you miss.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4k0d55q24o

The truth about life on other planets and what it means for Earth,Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other?,BBC InDepth,"Science & Environment, Mars, Nasa, Extraterrestrial life, Planets, Space exploration",Pallab Ghosh,2025-04-17T00:11:47.614Z,2025-04-17T00:11:47.614Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/468f/live/8b7c5530-1b6a-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/468f/live/8b7c5530-1b6a-11f0-a455-cf1d5f751d2f.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8jwj90ejno,"Listen to this article on BBC Sounds

There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.

One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.

Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.

""This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,"" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.

But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?

Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.

It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.

But decades on, what has been described as ""the strongest evidence yet"" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.

Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.

Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.

Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.

Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.

But many are in what astronomers call ""The Goldilocks Zone"" where the distance is ""just right"" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.

As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.

The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.

And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.

Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.

But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)

Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.

It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.

Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.

Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.

Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.

""With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence"".

The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.

In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.

A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.

The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.

The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.

China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.

But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.

""It is a long, slow process,"" she says. ""The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.

""You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route"".

Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles‘ song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with ""marmalade skies"".

Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.

Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?

""I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,"" she says, beaming with delight.

""Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.

If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.

Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be ""pretty common"" in the galaxy. ""But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.""

Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.

""When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.

""The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?""

He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.

As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves ""more displaced"" from that point. ""I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,"" he says.

Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.

""The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.

""If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger"".

Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.

""When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.

""It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,"" he continues.

""It will be another step in our evolution"".

Donald Trump's return to the White House is a ""major blow to global climate action"". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November.

Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets.

Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a ""green new scam"".

And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada – both nations rich in critical minerals.

Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology.

So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector?

Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla – the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets).

Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium.

She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors.

Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency.

Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: ""Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.""

He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow.

The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: ""The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.""

Failure to do so, it warned, could cause ""defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies"".

China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers.

""China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,"" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.

Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. ""You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.""

Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply – like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray.

China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock).

""China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,"" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.

She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten.

What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

""I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,"" he says. ""It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.""

As he puts it, it is a ""happy coincidence"" that this could end up supporting green technology.

The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector.

In the early days, the green transition was ""framed as a burden"" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.

The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.

By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (£382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor.

And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer.

But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening.

""The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,"" explains Ms Gray.

""Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.""

There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a ""Critical Minerals Executive Order"", which could funnel further investment into this objective.

The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants.

Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. ""If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.""

As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed ""big, beautiful bill"" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month.

Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment.

MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the ""battery belt"" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive.

He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years.

If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.

Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. ""In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.""

He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA – although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. ""If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.""

But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. ""When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.""

For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.

Plane GPS systems are under sustained attack - is the solution a new atomic clock?,How a new atomic clock might be the way to tackle attacks on plane GPS systems,BBC InDepth,"Aviation accidents and incidents, GPS",Pallab Ghosh,2025-03-03T00:39:34.086Z,2025-03-03T00:39:34.086Z,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ed7c/live/705a2b40-f524-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.png,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/ed7c/live/705a2b40-f524-11ef-9e61-71ee71f26eb1.png,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6yg204pvmo,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion.

The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"".

This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.

The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017,a government report statedthat systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.

To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.

Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.

The potential cost of losing GPS has beenput at £1.4bn each day– no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.

With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution.

The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years.

In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent.

The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration.

Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative.

""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.

In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.

The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation.

The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.

But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.

""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.""

Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium.

GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.

The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.

When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.

""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News.

The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.

Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul.

Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.""

While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on boardcarried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"".

By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.

But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.

Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"".

Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems.

GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons.

""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out.

""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"".

The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones.

This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going.

QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone.

That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul.

Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small.

But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea.

""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist.

""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.""

Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong.

Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough?

One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

Billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman has a big vision for the future of humanity.

He set off on his first mission to space in 2021 – a private journey he paid an estimated $200m (£160m) for – and announced that he wanted space travel to be for the masses, not only for the 600 who have experienced it to date – most of them professional astronauts employed by Nasa and the wealthy.

""We want it to be 600,000,"" he told reporters.

Later, he added: ""I drank the Kool-Aid in terms of the grand ambitions for humankind being a multi-planet species… I think that we all want to live in a Star Wars, Star Trek world where people are jumping in their spacecraft.""

Mr Isaacman, who made much of his $1.9bn (£1.46bn) fortune from a payment processing company that he founded in 1999 aged 16, is said to have bankrolled the rest of the crew of four aboard the SpaceX craft in the 2021 mission, fuelled by a longstanding love of flying and fascination with space.

Since then, there have been more adventures: last year he demonstrated Captain Kirk-like daring by travelling in an upgraded SpaceX capsule andperforming the first commercial spacewalk.

During the mission, he tested an experimental spacesuit and a new cost-saving protocol to exit and re-enter the spacecraft without using an airlock.

The photograph of Mr Isaacman, silhouetted with the world at his feet, is now iconic – it demonstrated that this was not a playboy billionaire paying to act out Star Trek, but someone pushing the envelope of what was possible with current technology.

And yet it is a more recent achievement that has drawn greater attention still – being nominated by Donald Trump in December to be the new head of Nasa.

The question is why Trump chose him and what has he asked him to do – especially in the context that the President has appointed SpaceX ownerElon Musk to a government roleto cut $2 trillion (£1.6 trillion) off the Federal budget.

The Nasa post is a presidential appointment, though it requires the confirmation of the US Senate. And if confirmed, Mr Isaacman's appointment will also raise broader questions about the future of humanity in space, given his vision for space travel for the masses. It also has significant implications for the future of the space agency, if Mr Isaacman's role leads to Nasa using the private sector even more than it does now.

In the past, the heads of Nasa have come from a variety of backgrounds: some, such as the previous incumbent Bill Nelson, have been former astronauts; others, such as Michael Griffin (in charge from 2005 to 2009) came from a government background, and before him Dan Goldin was an entrepreneur, striving to lower costs.

Despite their disparate backgrounds, those who have led Nasa have all been company people, charged with defending the space agency and its values.

And yet Mr Isaacman, along with Mr Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, is among a new wave of billionaires who have been challenging the old order in space.

They have accelerated the pace of innovation and are aiming to dramatically reduce the cost of human space travel.

On the day of his nomination in December, Mr Isaacman posted a statement on X that gave an early glimpse into his vision. ""This second space age has only just begun,"" he wrote.

""There will inevitably be a thriving space economy – one that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space… At Nasa, we will… usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilisation.""

Many presidents have talked about sending astronauts to the Moon since the end of the Apollo lunar landings of the 1960s and 70s, butTrump was the first to turn talk into action, authorising Nasa's Artemis programme to send humans back to the Moon during his first term. His record suggests that he is a big Nasa fan.

But since then, two factors are likely to have changed his thinking: Nasa's rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), has been delayed and costs have spiralled; at the same time Mr Musk's SpaceX and Bezos's Blue Origin are developing reusable low-cost Moon rockets.

That is a worrying backdrop for Nasa, according to Courtney Stadd of New York-based Beyond Earth Institute think tank.

""You have a government looking to slash,"" he said at a webinar hosted by Space News. ""If you are the new administrator, you are going in in that context, so you are going to have to look at everything that is a drain on your budget…

""This next two years is going to be the equivalent of a tsunami and everything is on the table.""

One of the biggest questions is what to do with the space agency's SLS Moon rocket. In 2021, Nasa's Office of Inspector General (OIG), which provides oversight of the space agency for Congress, reported that the cost was $4.1bn (£3.3bn) for each and every launch.

By contrast, SpaceX's equivalent rocket system, Starship, is estimated to cost around $100m (£80m) per launch – and Musk has said he aims to bring the costs down further to $10m (£8m) as he develops his system.

Bezos's new Moon rocket, New Glenn, had its maiden test launch at the beginning of January. Blue Origin has not announced its cost per launch, but it is estimated currently to be around $68m (£54.5m).

Competition between the two billionaires is likely to speed up innovation and reduce costs further.

Starshipand New Glenn are projected to be cheaper because, unlike SLS, they are designed to be reusable. But ""that's only a part of the reason for the disparity in costs"", according to Dr Adam Baker, an expert on the space industry at Cranfield University.

""SpaceX is given a sum of money and contracted to deliver on time and on budget,"" he continues. ""They are driven by profit, and they want to minimise costs.

""A Nasa programme is not driven by profit; it is driven by the programme objectives and so those in charge don't think they need to track costs in the same way.

""There is a general acceptance that SLS has no future.""

The OIG could only come up with a best guess for the full cost of the Artemis programme in its review for Congress because, as it put it: ""Nasa lacks a comprehensive and accurate cost estimate that accounts for all programme costs.

""Instead, the Agency's plan presents a rough estimate that excludes $25bn (£20bn) for key activities"".

Nasa's project management of SLS is not an aberration – some would say it is typical. For example, the James Webb Space Telescope was given a $1bn (£800m) budget and a launch date of 2010 – but it cost ten times that amount and launched in 2021, earning it the nickname of ""the telescope that ate astronomy"".

(Other important scientific programmes had to be scaled back, delayed or scrapped entirely to make way for the overruns.)

It was a similar story of delays and budget overruns during the development of the Space Shuttle in the 1970s and the construction of the International Space Station in the 2000s.

Nasa got away with it because it was responsible for arguably America's greatest moment when it sent the first astronauts to the Moon. The Apollo programme laid the foundations for America's technology businesses and ushered in a vibrant new era for the US.

But the world has changed significantly since then, and Nasa has simply not kept up, according to Emeritus Prof John Logsdon, former director of the Space policy Institute at George Washington University. ""Changing the way the United States goes about its civilian space programme is long overdue.""

The current model is to give so-called ""cost-plus"" contracts to big heritage aerospace companies, such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing, which guarantee to pay the development costs and an agreed profit.

The model gave the firms the financial reassurance they needed for ambitious projects such as the space shuttle, the SLS, and developing parts of the Saturn V rocket that tookApollo astronauts to the Moon, but these contracts provided no incentives to cut costs or increase efficiency. For example, there were no penalties for delays or cost overruns.

Dr Simeon Barber at the Open University, who has worked with Nasa on robotic space missions, was originally sceptical that the new commercial companies would deliver. But he is now a convert to the new way of doing things.

""We were used to big projects falling behind schedule and going over budget. But the new companies have shone a light on the old way of doing things.""

Moves to change what some saw as an overly cosy relationship with the heritage space companies gained pace in 2009 when President Obama introduced fixed-price contracts to some private sector firms. The companies were given latitude to innovate to cut costs and increase their profits provided they delivered on schedule and on budget.

Among those firms was the dynamic new start-up, SpaceX, which was awarded a contract to develop its reusable Falcon rockets and Dragon Space capsule to resupply the International Space Station with crew and cargo.

The heritage space company Boeing was also given a similar contract in 2014 to develop its Starliner capsule to do the same job.

SpaceX, with its riskier but faster development processes, began delivering to the ISS within four years of receiving its contract. By contrast, Boeing's Starliner, which had a series of delays due to technical problems and cost overruns, took 10 years – only to have more issues with some of its engines, which left astronautsButch Wilmore and Suni Williams stranded on the space station.

The ultimate humiliation is that they will be brought back to Earth by rival SpaceX's Dragon capsule.

""Starliner is an embarrassment for the traditional way of doing business,"" says Prof Logsdon. ""So, shaking up the system is very positive.""

Prof Logsdon expects big changes under Trump, Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman: scrapping programmes, closing Nasa centres and more contracting out to SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private sector firms. Mr Isaacman has called the SLS ""outrageously expensive"" and said that the major aerospace contractors are ""incentivised to be economically inefficient"".

But changes like that are not going to be easy. Nasa's budget is controlled by Congress. Although President Trump's party controls both legislative houses, individual senators and congressmen on the committees that oversee Nasa are from states with jobs and industries dependent on Nasa's $25bn (£20bn) annual budget.

""Party discipline takes second place where there is constituency money involved,"" says Prof Logsdon, a seasoned watcher of the horse trading that goes on with space politics in Congress.

Although Nasa's projects have been expensive, they have shown us the wonders of the universe and shifted humanity's perception of ourselves and our place in the cosmos.

The creation of the first reusable space shuttle, the construction of an orbiting space station, the images of distant worlds captured by its robotic spacecraft and the awe-inspiring photos from Hubble have all inspired generations and supercharged interest in science. As a result, senators and congressmen know that America and the world owe Nasa an unpayable debt.

""The old way of doing things gave us a lot of success, so you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater. There will be significant change, but not the radical change that Mr Musk and Mr Isaacman want to see,"" argues Prof Logsdon.

""There is a delicate balance between the interests of Nasa, Congress and the White House.""

Where that balance will fall will emerge in the coming months: some are speculating that the return-to-the-Moon programme might be scrapped altogether in favour of going straight to Mars, as President Trump alluded to during his inauguration, with the greatest proponent of that policy – Musk – seated nearby.

Others fear cuts inNasa's Earth Observation programmes, which monitor and model environmental changes from space, and include the impact of climate change; and some worry that the robotic scientific missions to other planets might be cut back to boost efforts for the human spaceflight programme.

There is concern in some quarters about the close relationship between Mr Isaacman and Mr Musk. Mr Isaacman paid SpaceX for his two ventures into space. The company has already received $20bn (£16bn) in contracts from government since 2008.

But if SLS is scrapped, and SpaceX were to receive the lion's share of Nasa's Moon programme work, Mr Musk's firm stands to receive contracts that might be ten or even a hundred times greater, possibly at the expense of other private-sector players.

And there are many innovative US start-up companies hoping to build parts for spacecraft and infrastructure in Nasa's return-to-the-Moon programme, including Texas-based Firefly, which has a spacecraft on its way to land on the Moon in March.

But industry analysts say that the US government has a long tradition of breaking up monopolies so that they don't stifle innovation. And in any case, just because Mr Isaacman has worked with Mr Musk, it does not mean that any outcome is inevitable, argues Prof Logsdon.

""Isaacman is his own man,"" he adds. ""He is not a disciple of Elon Musk.""

Ultimately, however, it has become painfully clear, even to Nasa's most ardent supporters, that it needs saving from itself. And the need for Nasa reform is not a partisan issue – Democrat and Republican presidents alike have set the wheels in motion.

But the coincidental timing of the success of SpaceX, Blue Origin and other private-sector space firms with a new administration impatient to cut costs and energise the private sector means that Mr Isaacman has a unique opportunity to make some of the biggest changes to Nasa since its inception.

""Nasa truly is a crown jewel, and we aren't doing what we should be doing on behalf of the American people,"" argued former deputy head of Nasa Lori Garver during the Space News webinar. ""That is frustrating for all of us.""

Asked if a private sector billionaire was the right person to be entrusted with one of America's greatest national treasures, Ms Garver responded: ""Jared is a patriot, and he is doing this for public service.

""The truth of Jared agreeing has something to do with him willing to take on these hard things – and there are so many hard things"".

Fatbergs turned into perfume: Britain's new industrial revolution,"The UK led the way in this field of science until recently - but now other countries have overtaken.

In a gleaming laboratory in Edinburgh, robotic machines whirr and mix. The final product that they are creating will be a pine-smelling chemical that can be used as an ingredient in perfumes. But the starting point is very different: a brown, gloopy, fat mixture, recently fished out from below ground - fatbergs.

Fatbergs are the foul phenomenon found lurking in (and blocking up) sewers. The development of the technology used to perform this apparent alchemy is being described by some as a new industrial revolution.

This is the fast-moving field of bioengineering. The good news is that Britain is currently strong in the science compared with other countries.

It is potentially great news for the environment too because it can recycle waste and make things more sustainably. Plus the government is keen because it may mean new industries and new jobs.

But the British lead has slipped away recently because of a lack of investment, poor regulation and the wrong policies. The question now is, can it be recovered?

And if it can, at what cost? Because some experts are concerned that certain potential risks are being overlooked amid the enthusiasm to reap the benefits - and to win back the lead.

Prof Stephen Wallace from the University of Edinburgh is among those turning the fatbergs into perfumes. ""It's a crazy idea,"" he admits to me, ""but it works.""

Fatbergs are accumulated lumps of fat from cooking oils, toilet and other food waste that people put down their drains. Prof Wallace gets his from a company that specialises in fishing them out of sewers and turning them into biofuels. They arrive at the lab in a tube.

The first step is to sterilise the material in a steamer. Prof Wallace then adds the specially modified bacteria to the remnants of the fatberg. The bacteria have a short section of DNA inserted, to give the bacteria their particular properties.

The fatberg gradually disappears, as the bacteria eat it, producing the chemical with the pine-like smell - this can be used as an ingredient in perfumes.

Prof Wallace says that while the UK has taken a lead role in establishing the technology, it now needs to show it can go to the next step. ""We are at this nervous point where the core technology that enables a huge range of sustainable industrial technologies is established and we are now progressing to the stage of scaling up to manufacturing.

""But there is a challenge in the UK to create infrastructure... and progress to commercialisation at a rate that is comparable to investment in Europe and the US.""

If the UK can scale up, the appetite for investment appears to be there. Prof Wallace is working with two perfume companies that are interested in the process because it is more sustainable than the method they currently use, which involves making the fragrance from chemicals extracted from fossil fuels.

But while the basic technology exists, it is advancing at break-neck speed, meaning the UK's leading role is insecure.

One of Stephen's colleagues, Dr Joanna Sadler, has created microbes that turn used plastic, that would otherwise damage the environment, into vanilla essence and other useful and expensive chemicals.

""Since I first published the work four or five years ago, the field has absolutely exploded, not just in the UK but across the world,"" she tells me. ""It's an extremely fast-moving field.""

One member of the University of Edinburgh's hub has created bugs that extract important metals from burnt-out batteries, which would otherwise leak noxious chemicals into landfill. Another is turning waste water from whisky distillation into a plant-based alternative to fish-oil health supplements.

The possibilities are endless, and innovation has accelerated because of the development of cheap and accurate ways of manipulating DNA. It means it is now much easier to harness and adapt the power of nature to create all sorts of things.

However all those possibilities require funding.

The technology was set as a national priority by the previous government in December 2023 with the publication of a policy document called the National Vision for Engineering Biology and an allocation of £2bn over 10 years. The Labour government has indicated that it too regards it as a priority but has made no firm spending commitment.

On the face of it, engineering biology could help Labour achieve two of its five big priorities in government: growth and sustainability. But at present the funding remains uncertain.

The chief scientific advisor Prof Angela McLean, whom the Prime Minister turns to for matters scientific, has been looking into this.

""We are looking for products like this handbag,"" Prof McLean explained, while stroking a faux leather handbag made by one of the many new start-up engineering biology companies spinning out of university research.

Modern Synthesis based south London made the bag from material grown from a non-genetically engineered microbe.

""They will be much less polluting, much more sustainable than their current equivalents, as well as generate great jobs, good environment and prosperity,"" she continues.

""Engineering biology is something the UK is really good at and the world is going to need. It is in its infancy and we need to keep on investing in it as a country.""

In the 20th Century, the UK led the way in the basic sciences of electronics, computing and the biosciences. But, with some notable exceptions, scientific excellence in these sectors was not translated into truly large world-leading businesses.

In all these cases, there was initial government enthusiasm and funding, but no follow-through. That meant that the science and ideas were bought up by mostly US companies, generating wealth and jobs overseas.

The fear that the UK is losing its way is highlighted in a newHouse of Lords report, which was out on the 14 January, that says that engineering biology risks going down the same path for exactly the same reasons.

It states that ""other countries are beginning to overtake the UK, and we are at severe risk of losing the prospective benefits of a world-leading engineering biology sector"".

The report also says that there is a ""small but closing window"" to make some small policy tweaks that could make a huge difference, such as recommitting to the target set out in the National Vision for at least £2 billion of funding over the next decade.

Professor Susan Rosser, co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry, told the Lords Science and Technology committee, which produced the report, ""we were ahead of the game, but we have lost that leadership because of substantial investments in the US and Korea"".

She said: ""We are losing trained people overseas. People from Edinburgh have moved to Singapore, the States, Germany and Austria.

""If this is genuinely going to be a key part of our economy, we need the skill set trained, and as soon as possible.""

Dr Carolina Grandellis, a biofoundry manager at the Earlham Institute research park in Norwich, added that it was hard to replenish the brain drain by attracting scientists from overseas because of a tightening of the visa system by both the previous and current government.

""The government intends to increase restrictions on legal skilled migration. That will have a cost for our field.""

According to Baroness Brown of Cambridge, who chairs the Lords committee, the heart of the problem is that there is no clear plan to increase the number of skilled scientists or to have the right policies and regulations in place to enable engineering biology to flourish in the UK.

""All too often we hear that when companies reach a certain size, they move abroad for better investment and development prospects, taking most of the economic benefit with them,"" she says. ""This requires urgent action"".

Another issue is that the UK biofoundries, like the one at Edinburgh University, are not properly funded, according to Prof Paul Freemont, who is a co-director of a biofoundry at Imperial College, London.

""The scale of investment in biofoundries internationally is enormous. In Korea, it just announced $100m (£82m) for a K-Biofoundry. In Shenzhen in China, about $750m (£614m) has gone into a building in which each floor [studies] an organism.

""Our biofoundry in London had £7m of public investment in infrastructure and we have had no funding for staff. We are constantly scrabbling for cash"".

Not all funding can come from government. But the Lords' report found that enough private investment was not forthcoming either. Unlike in the US, UK investors expect returns in a few years, rather than the tens of years that innovative companies need for their ideas to really start making money.

A further barrier for the field is its regulation by government, especially for applications for producing novel foods, according to Will Milligan CEO of Extracellular, which provides products to firms making lab-grown meat.

""Singapore, on the other hand, has a very clear framework for the approval process in bringing products to market, and the recommended timelines are about half what they are in the UK.""

In response to criticisms, the government has set up a body to cut through the red tape, the Regulatory Innovation Office.

But ""streamlining does mean deregulation, in many circumstances"", argues Dr Helen Wallace, director of the campaign group Gene Watch. She worries that the risks of engineering biology are being overlooked by the government in its enthusiasm to reap the claimed benefits.

Many applications of the technology involve creating entirely new organisms which are contained inside large vats in the production process. Even if they were to escape, they are unlikely to survive as they have been engineered to thrive in the very specific, artificial conditions they were designed for.

But Dr Wallace is concerned about some applications that are designed to be released into the environment. ""There is one in the US which is made to survive and reproduce in the soil to boost nitrogen levels, which is very worrying because even very small changes in their DNA could make them more harmful to people, animals and plants.

""This could create a new kind of living pollution that could spread in rivers, the sea, the air, in rain and you would not be able to reverse any adverse consequences"".

Scientists and industrialists agree that without public trust, this shining new industry is going nowhere. And to win trust, the advocates of engineering biology must be open and honest about the risks.

More worrisome is that progress in bioengineering could one day lead to the creation of dangerous superbugs that could spread disease or create environmental problems by disrupting delicately balanced ecosystems.

A group of 38 leading scientists recently expressed concern about the creation of ""mirror life"", which would be artificially created organisms whose DNA is the mirror image of their naturally occurring counterparts.

Writing in the journal Science, they said that while the capability to create mirror life is likely at least a decade away and would require large investments and major technical advances, these mirror organisms could pose serious risks and rip through the immune systems of plants and animals. The scientists have called for a moratorium on their creation until more is known about them and what steps can be taken to minimise risks.

Without action to reduce the risks, developments in biotechnology could increase the risk of bioterrorism in the future

Government and manufacturers think that there are considerable environmental and economic benefits to this technology. But if the public won't accept it, there's no point to all this increased investment: it won't be used; no one will buy the products. And there are real risks: scientists and campaigners want the public to be fully informed, in an open and transparent way.

Prof Freemont admits that in their enthusiasm for the good that engineering biology can bring. ""We've taken our eye off the ball a little bit in engaging with the public.

""The sector needs to ensure that the general consumer and citizen can begin to understand this technology"".
